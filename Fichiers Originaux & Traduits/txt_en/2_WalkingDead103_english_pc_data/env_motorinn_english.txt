7)  DUCK
{happyC}You're the greatest detective and I can be Dick Grayson! Your ward!
8)  DUCK
{happya}That's Robin.
9)  LEE
{angryb}[annoyed] I know who it is.
10)  
You can help. Don't tell anyone.

No. If you tell anybody, there will be trouble.
12)  
Fine, you're Robin.
13)  DUCK
{happya}Secrecy!

27)  DUCK
{fearA}[small] What do I do?
17)  LEE
{thinkingA}I don't know. {normalC}Go look around. Let me know if you find anything {disgustA}weird.
28)  LEE
{thinkingA}I don't know. {normalC}Go look around. Let me know if you find anything {disgustA}weird.

29)  DUCK
{happyA}I'm on the case!
19)  LEE

30)  DUCK
{thinkingA}I will live in the shadows!
22)  LEE
{angryB}Did you hear what I just said?
23)  DUCK
I won't tell a soul.
24)  LEE
{angryb}The part about not helping. {angryC}You can't help.
25)  DUCK
{happyB}Yes!
26)  LEE
{ThinkingB}Okay, you're Robin.
31)  LEE
{thinkingA} There's some broken glass on the ground there.
32)  LEE
{thinkingA}Hmm.
33)  LEE
{thinkingB}There's something drawn there...
34)  DUCK
{happyA}A clue!
35)  LEE
{angryA}[frustrated] Maybe.
36)  DUCK
{normalA}What do you think it is?
37)  LEE
{thinkingA}Huh. Chalk.
38)  DUCK
{thinkingA}[whispering] Pink. Hmm.
39)  LEE
{angryB}[surprised]Duck!
40)  LEE
{angryC}I thought I told you couldn't help.
41)  DUCK
{sadA}I'm curious.
42)  LEE
{thinkingB}You don't say.
43)  LEE
{thinkingB}I don't think it's anything.
44)  DUCK
{happyb}Maybe it's a sign!
45)  LEE
{normalB}It could be. {thinkingA}It's pink chalk, which is {thinkingb}weird.
46)  DUCK
{thinkingA}Okay, {happyA}back to investigating!
47)  LEE
{thinkingA}More chalk...
48)  LEE
{normalC}Somebody was over here too.
49)  LEE
{normalA}Yeah, Duck, you did.
50)  DUCK
{happya}See, I did good, huh.
51)  DUCK
{normalA}Okay.
52)  LEE
{thinkingA}I suppose I should go out there and look around.
53)  LEE
{normalA}You stay here this time. {normalC}Seriously.
54)  LEE
{normalB}Not gonna shoot that.
55)  LEE
{thinkingA}Huh. There's {fearA}something in there... [worried]
56)  LEE
{normalB}There's a grate down there.
57)  LEE
{thinkingB}[tiny effort] Hmmph.
58)  LEE
{normalB}It's a bag of something.
59)  LEE
{fearA}[disbelief, quiet] Son of a bitch...
60)  LEE
{thinkingA}Sounds like Kenny actually has that thing running. {HappyA}I'll believe it when I see it.
61)  LEE
{normalA} It's Lilly's room.
62)  LEE
{normalB}I don't need to go in there.
63)  LEE
{normalB}It's locked up.
64)  DUCK
{happyA}I found something.
65)  LEE
{thinkingA}What is it?
66)  LEE
{thinkingA}Yeah, Duck, I got it. {normalA}Good job.
67)  DUCK
{happyc}Cool!
68)  DUCK
{happyb}I found this piece of pink chalk and a scuff of it over by the gate!
69)  LEE
{normalA}Really?
70)  DUCK
{happyc}Totally!
71)  DUCK
{normalA}Psst, Lee.
72)  DUCK
{happya}I was combing the scene for clues and--
73)  KATJAA
{sadA}Would you?
103)  KATJAA
{sadA}Would you?
74)  KENNY
{normalC}I'd do what it takes.
105)  KENNY
{normalC}I'd do what it takes.
75)  KENNY
{sadA}She's gonna have to let this go...
104)  KENNY
{sadA}She's gonna have to let this go...
76)  LEE
{normalB}Yep. {thinkingA} I've just been calling 'em "days" lately.
108)  LEE
{normalB}Yep. {thinkingA} I've just been calling 'em "days" lately.
77)  DOUG
And now if she's paranoid? That's a bad mix.
106)  DOUG
And now if she's paranoid? That's a bad mix.
78)  DOUG
I don't know what it is but it's probably worth talking to Lilly about things going missing. Ever since her dad died she's been a live wire.
109)  DOUG
I don't know what it is but it's probably worth talking to Lilly about things going missing. Ever since her dad died she's been a live wire.
79)  DOUG
Uh, rough day, I guess.
107)  DOUG
Uh, rough day, I guess.
80)  LEE
{normalD}No question.
115)  LEE
{normalD}No question.
81)  LEE
{sadA}You could say that.
110)  LEE
{sadA}You could say that.
82)  CARLEY
Well, I think you did good today. And I find myself thinking that most days.
117)  CARLEY
Well, I think you did good today. And I find myself thinking that most days.
83)  CARLEY
It's probably worth following up with Lilly about what she was saying about missing supplies.
112)  CARLEY
It's probably worth following up with Lilly about what she was saying about missing supplies.
84)  CARLEY
With her wound up the way she is, I don't want to see her paranoid.
114)  CARLEY
With her wound up the way she is, I don't want to see her paranoid.
85)  LEE
{normalA}Thanks.
116)  LEE
{normalA}Thanks.
86)  CARLEY
Oof. Things are coming to a head.
111)  CARLEY
Oof. Things are coming to a head.
87)  CARLEY
And I'd like to talk, when you've got a minute.
113)  CARLEY
And I'd like to talk, when you've got a minute.
88)  
She'll get over it.

121)  KENNY
{angryA}She's riling everybody up, otherwise.
92)  
She's right.
122)  
She's right.
93)  LEE
{angryA}She's right, you know. {normalC}Shit's just getting worse by the day.
125)  LEE
{angryA}She's right, you know. {normalC}Shit's just getting worse by the day.
94)  KENNY
{angryA}Whatever, Lee. You've picked your sides.
123)  KENNY
{angryA}Whatever, Lee. You've picked your sides.
95)  KATJAA
{sadA}Ken, that's not fair.
124)  KATJAA
{sadA}Ken, that's not fair.
96)  
Happy, Kenny?
126)  
Happy, Kenny?
97)  LEE
{AngryA} Happy, Kenny?
127)  LEE
{AngryA} Happy, Kenny?
98)  KATJAA
{sadA}Everyone is under great stress.
128)  KATJAA
{sadA}Everyone is under great stress.

{normalC}My family's alive and that RV is runnin.' You're goddamn right I am.

[pickup2] It's the chalk mark Duck found.
158)  LEE
[pickup2] Hmm. Definitely weird.

[pickup2] Someone was probably just clumsy.
160)  LEE
[pickup2] It can't just be a coincidence.
