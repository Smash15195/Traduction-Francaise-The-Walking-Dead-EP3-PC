1)  CLEMENTINE
Sorry.
2)  LEE
{normalc}{body-B}You should wait for me before trying to open doors.
3)  LEE
{thinkinga}Luckily it's locked. {happya}We'll get better at working together.
4)  CLEMENTINE
Maybe I could look in?
5)  LEE
{thinkinga}{body-b}The window's open up there.
6)  CLEMENTINE
Sounds good.
7)  LEE
{happya}{body-b}Why don't I put you on my shoulders and you can peek into that window up there.
8)  LEE
{normalb}{body-b}We'll have to find a way in.
9)  
What do you see?
10)  
Getting this door open is going to be tough.
11)  
Jump in if you can.
12)  LEE
{sada}{body-B}What do you see?
13)  CLEMENTINE
Lots of crates and stuff.
14)  CLEMENTINE
I think I opened it.
15)  LEE
{surpriseb}{body-B}For real?
16)  CLEMENTINE
I think so.
17)  LEE
{happyc}Well I'll be damned.
18)  CLEMENTINE
Let's go. Be careful.
19)  LEE
{happyb}{body-B}I'm supposed to tell you that.
20)  LEE
{thinkinga}Maybe we can find the key or figure out a way to knock this door down. {normalb}Kenny'd probably have me pick the lock, {thinkinga}which actually might work now that we have the time... {thinkingb}Hmm....
23)  LEE
{thinkinga}Maybe we can find the key or figure out a way to knock this door down. {normalb}Kenny'd probably have me pick the lock, {thinkinga}which actually might work now that we have the time... {thinkingb}Hmm....
21)  LEE
{angrya}{body-B}Getting this door open is going to be tough.
22)  CLEMENTINE
It might not be that hard.
24)  LEE
{normala}{body-B}Jump in if you can.
25)  CLEMENTINE
What about staying together?
26)  LEE
{angrya}If there aren't any walkers in there, {happya}you'll be fine.
27)  CLEMENTINE
It's too far to fall.
28)  LEE
{normald}Well, what do you think we should do?
29)  CLEMENTINE
Grr... fine. Can you get me closer, please?
30)  CLEMENTINE
Okay, I can see in, what do I do now?
31)  CLEMENTINE
Maybe I can hold the door open?
32)  LEE
{angryb}I don't like that. {normalb}I'll prop it open with something.
33)  LEE
{angrya}Goddamn it's dark in here.
34)  CLEMENTINE
It's way too dark.
35)  LEE
{angrya}{body-B}Yeah, you're right.
36)  LEE
{sadb}I don't like it when I only have our gun to protect us.
107)  LEE
{sadb}I don't like it when I only have our gun to protect us.
110)  LEE
{sadb}I don't like it when I only have our gun to protect us.
37)  CLEMENTINE
The noise, right?
108)  CLEMENTINE
The noise, right?
112)  CLEMENTINE
The noise, right?
38)  LEE
{happya}Exactly.
109)  LEE
{happya}Exactly.
111)  LEE
{happya}Exactly.
39)  LEE
{angryc}{body-b}[shoulder shove into door]
40)  LEE
{sada}Yeah, won't budge.
41)  LEE
{thinkinga}{body-b}I can't see in there.
42)  LEE
{happyb}{body-b}How we doin'?
43)  CLEMENTINE
Good. What do we need?
44)  LEE
{normalb}Something to help us deal with the tanker out there.
45)  LEE
{sada}{body-b}You okay going over the top of this fence?
46)  CLEMENTINE
Yeah, definitely.
47)  LEE
{normalb}{body-b}The keys are on the opposite wall. {angrya}Grab them and get this gate open.
48)  LEE
{thinkinga}{body-b}It's locked up good, {normalc}but there's some space at the top.
49)  CLEMENTINE
We're lucky I'm so little.
50)  LEE
{happyb}Yeah, we are.
51)  LEE
{angryb}{body-b}Goddammit, it's locked!
52)  LEE
{angrya}{body-b}Locked up good.
53)  LEE
{angryc}{body-b}Fuck, it's still locked!
54)  LEE
{angrya}That's exactly {happya}what we need.
55)  CLEMENTINE
Over there?
56)  LEE
{normalb}Yeah. We need to get in there and get that blowtorch.
57)  LEE
[phew]  {happyb}{body-b}We got it.
58)  CLEMENTINE
Let's go outside now.
59)  LEE
{normalb}What did we learn?
60)  CLEMENTINE
I'm not ready for a gun.
61)  LEE
{angrya}No, Clem. We learned that everything we will ever do is dangerous. {normalc}We'll get better, smarter and faster. {happya}Okay?
62)  CLEMENTINE
Okay.
63)  LEE
{normalb}{body-b}There are keys over there.
64)  CLEMENTINE
For the gate?
65)  LEE
{sada}I hope so.
66)  LEE
{angrya}{body-b}Can't reach 'em from here.
67)  LEE
{sada}{body-b}Wish that thing was in my hands instead of over there.
68)  CLEMENTINE
It's too dark otherwise.
69)  LEE
{happyb}{body-b}Go on and grab the keys, Clem.
70)  LEE
{normalb}Come on, scoot.
71)  CLEMENTINE
{fearb}{body-stand}Behind you!
72)  LEE
{surpriseB}Fuck!
73)  LEE
{angryC}[UGH!]
74)  LEE
{sada}{body-b}It's okay...it's okay... everything's fine.
75)  LEE
{angryC}KEYS! NOW!
76)  LEE
{angryd}SHIIIT!
77)  LEE
{sadc}{body-b}[recovering]
78)  LEE
{angryb}God...damn...
79)  CLEMENTINE
That didn't go so good.
80)  LEE
{sada}No, it did {surpriseb}not go so good. {normalb}But we're okay. {happya}Everything's okay.

[through a door] {angrya}What's going on? I thought I heard a gunshot.
124)  LEE
[pickup2] [unnerved] We're fine.
125)  LEE
[pickup2] [not sure what to say] We found some walkers.
126)  CHRISTA
{thinkinga}You and an eight year old versus three of them, huh?
127)  
We handled it.
128)  
Mind your own business.
129)  
It was stupid.
130)  LEE
[pickup2] Mind your own business. If we wanted you to help out we would've asked.
131)  CHRISTA
{angrya}If you two were to die in here, three dead turns to five and THAT'S my business.
132)  LEE
[pickup2] Good thing it didn't happen, then.
133)  LEE
[pickup2] It was stupid.
134)  CHRISTA
{normalb}You think? [sarc but stern]
135)  LEE
[pickup2] What do you want me to say? I'm trying to teach her how to take care of herself. We're getting used to working together.
136)  LEE
[pickup2] We handled it.
137)  CHRISTA
{normalb}Yeah, it looks like. {angrya}What if you hadn't?
138)  CHRISTA
{thinkinga}....Looks like it worked out for you. {normalb}Probably ought to be a little more careful when using a gun. Noise and all.
139)  CLEMENTINE
[pickup2] We know.
140)  CHRISTA
{normalb}I'm going to go make sure the noise didn't cause us any problems.
141)  CLEMENTINE
[pickup2] That's a good idea.
142)  CHRISTA
{angryA}I hope you know what you're doing with her.
143)  
We're still alive, aren't we?
144)  
Me too.
145)  
I don't.
146)  LEE
[pickup2]We're still alive, aren't we?
147)  CHRISTA
{normala}Yes, you are.
148)  LEE
[pickup2]Me too.
149)  CHRISTA
{sada}For her sake.
150)  LEE
[pickup2]I don't.
151)  CHRISTA
{thinkinga}Then she's more impressive than I thought.

[pickup2] I'll try.
165)  LEE
[pickup2] No, you just have to learn to pull the trigger.
166)  CLEMENTINE
[pickup2] It's so hard.
167)  LEE
[pickup2] Don't think, just do it. Live with what happens.
168)  LEE
[pickup2] We learned not to be afraid. They shoulda got us, but we got them.
169)  CLEMENTINE
[pickup2] Yeah, you're right.
170)  LEE
[pickup2] Fear is the thing that will kill us, you understand?
171)  LEE
[pickup2] Me, neither.
172)  CLEMENTINE
[pickup2] I'm sorry. I'll get better. I don't want us to die.
173)  LEE

[pickup2] Uh huh.

[pickup2] [to Clem, concerned]You sure you're okay?

178)  LEE
{fearA}You okay?
179)  LEE
[pickup2] Somebody was doing some painting.
180)  LEE
[pickup2] Somebody was doing A LOT of painting...
181)  LEE
[pickup2] That paint has been dry for months.
182)  LEE
[pickup2] Doesn't look like that thing's worked for years.
183)  LEE
[pickup2] There's gotta be something useful in here....
184)  LEE
[pickup2] They didn't have much business back then.
