224)  LEE
{DisgustA}Well, there's no room for that shit. {DisgustB}This isn't about you. {AngryB}It's about a woman back there who needs her husband and a {AngryC}boy who needs his dad.
225)  LEE
{FearA}{body-B}Stop thinking about yourself, man. {ThinkingB}You feel guilty; {AngryA}like you killed any chance of a miracle for Duck {AngryB}when you ran away from Shawn Greene.
