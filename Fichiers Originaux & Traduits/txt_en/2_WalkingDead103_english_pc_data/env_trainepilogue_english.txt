{thinkingA} We have to find a boat. {normalD} We just have to.
3)  KENNY
{sadA} We will.
4)  LEE
{thinkingA} I just think it's time she and I parted ways with you. {normalD} Omid and Christa can make their own call.
5)  LEE
{sadA} I'm sorry, we made a plan. {thinkingA} We talked it through.
6)  LEE
{disgustA} We're going our own way, {normalC} Clementine and me.
7)  KENNY
{disgustA} What the fuck does that mean?
8)  KENNY
{angryA} Hmmph.
9)  KENNY
That's not the plan.
10)  KENNY
I thought they were dead.
11)  LEE
[pickup 2] [new read: Odd pause after 'parents' and before 'get there.'] {normalD} We're finding Clementine's parents when we get there.
12)  LEE
{disgustA} Well, it's ours. {normalC} She and I talked it through.
13)  LEE
{thinkingA} Looking for them, then.
14)  
You'll never get over today.
15)  
You'll be all right.
16)  
It's just gotten too bad.
17)  KENNY
{sadA} That's why I keep thinking it.
18)  KENNY
{sadC} That's all I keep thinking.
19)  LEE
{thinkingA} Try to think about what's ahead of you.
20)  LEE
{sadA} You'll never get over today.
21)  KENNY
{sadA} I'll be alive, I guess. {sadC} Blood in my heart, blood in my brain at least.
28)  KENNY
{sadA} I'll be alive, I guess. {sadC} Blood in my heart, blood in my brain at least.
22)  LEE
{thinkingA} You'll be all right.
23)  LEE
{normalD} It's gotten too bad, you know? {sadA} You, me, {thinkingB} nobody can take all this.
24)  KENNY
[big sigh] {sadB} Me, too.
25)  KENNY
{sadC} But we have.
26)  LEE
{sadA} What we're supposed to do isn't clear anymore. {disgustA} I'd give anything to go back to fighting over the motel.
27)  KENNY
{sadC} Yeah. There ain't much to say.
29)  LEE
{surpriseB} Holy shit...
30)  CAMPMAN
[radio processed] Hell...o...oo...there?...
31)  CAMPMAN
[radio processed] Can't wait for you to get to Savannah, Clementine. I told your parents what you're doing and they can't wait to see you. Now, what I nee--[radio cuts out]
32)  LEE
{thinkingA} She's out cold like I never seen.
33)  LEE
{disgustB} What the...?
34)  LEE
{normalD} I'll leave you to your thoughts.
35)  KENNY
[heavy] {disgustA} Ya'll might want to rethink your plan.
36)  LEE
{fearA} Who the fuck...
37)  KENNY
{thinkingA} I don't know, {angryA} but we're going to find out.
38)  KENNY
{disgustA} Sounds like somebody knows where we're headed.
39)  KENNY
[pickup2] I thought that fucking thing was broken...
40)  LEE
[pickup2] So did I.
41)  KENNY
[pickup2] [alt] Well, it sounds like somebody knows where we're headed.
42)  KENNY
[pickup2] I don't know. But I doubt we're going to be happy when we find out.
43)  CAMPMAN
[pickup2][radioprocessed] Can't wait for you to get to Savannah, Clementine. I've got your parents right here, and you be sure to find me whether Lee wants you to or not. Now, what I need-- [radio cuts out]
44)  CAMPMAN
[pickup2] Can't wait for you to get to Savannah. I know you said Lee wants to help, but your parents want you to come alone, Clementine. I need you to--
45)  LEE
[pickup2] Who the fuck was that... if he's convinced Clementine that he has her parents...
