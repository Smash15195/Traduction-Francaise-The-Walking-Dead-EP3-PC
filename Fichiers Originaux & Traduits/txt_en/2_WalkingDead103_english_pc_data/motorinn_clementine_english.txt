11)  CLEMENTINE
{sadA}Okay.
12)  LEE
{normalA}Do you have anything to say?
13)  CLEMENTINE
{sada}I don't think so.
14)  LEE

15)  LEE
{sadA}Before I met you and before the plague I killed somebody.
16)  CLEMENTINE
{surprisedA}Oh. {sadA}So that's what...
17)  LEE
{normalD}Yeah, that's it.
18)  LEE
{sadA}It was a bad thing and there's no explaining it.
19)  CLEMENTINE
{sadA}Why are you telling me?
20)  LEE
{normalb}Because I didn't want to keep it to myself any more.
21)  LEE
{normalD}Do you have any questions?
22)  LEE
{normalD}You can go on back to your things.
23)  LEE
{thinkingA}Never mind, actually.
24)  CLEMENTINE
{fearA}Am I in trouble?
25)  LEE

{thinkingA}Hmm.
47)  CLEMENTINE
{normalB}Do you want blue?
48)  LEE
{normalA}No, no, it's okay.
49)

50)  LEE
{thinkingA}Have you seen anything strange going on?
51)  CLEMENTINE
{normalA}No, nothing then.
52)  LEE
{normalA}Okay.
53)  LEE
{normalB}I mean, other than everything that's happening out there.
54)  
You didn't break a flashlight, accidentally?
55)  LEE
{normalB}Like what?
56)  CLEMENTINE
{sadA}Putting a bug on his pillow.
57)  CLEMENTINE
{sadA}No, {thinkingB}did Duck say I did?
58)  LEE
{thinkingA}Did you do that?
59)  LEE
{normalA}No. {thinkingA}Did Duck break the flashlight?
60)  CLEMENTINE
{thinkingA}I don't think so. He's just always blaming me for stuff.
61)  LEE
{normalC}You didn't accidentally break a flashlight, did you?
62)  CLEMENTINE
[shy/embarassed] {sadA}Yes.
64)  CLEMENTINE
{thinkingA}I don't LIKE it here.
65)  CLEMENTINE

76)  
Whatcha doin' there?
77)  LEE
[pickup2]What's that you're working on, Clem?
78)  CLEMENTINE
[pickup2]It's called a leaf rubbing. My teacher Miss Moore showed us how to
do ‘em when we went to the Botanical Garden once.
79)  CLEMENTINE
[pickup2][holds up a half-completed rubbing in one hand and the leaf in the
other] See? It's the same! Uhm, kind of.
80)  LEE
