1)  KENNY
[yelling up. presumably to god] {angryD}FUUUUCK YOUUUUU.
2)  BEN
[small] Maybe we could walk?
3)  KENNY
[head in his hands] {angryA}That's fucking stupid, Ben.
4)  BEN
I'm just sayin...
5)  CHUCK
Hmm. I dunno; I ain't got much experience with yall's fortitude but we could probably deal with that. We got a goddamn train.
6)  KENNY
{angryB}That thing's not full of milk, Charles. {thinkingA}That's gas or diesel; something that's going to explode.
7)  CHUCK
YOU gotta get ahold of yourself. This is a crew here.
8)  KENNY
{disgustA}This ain't shit.
9)  CHUCK
This--
10)  OMID
Yo, you keep screaming like that and you're gonna get your face chewed off.
11)  CHRISTA
[pickup 2] [new read: - Second sentence is a little dry and quiet; she's yelling down to those guys, trying to sound intimidating.] Are you guys going to be trouble? Because we could've just kept walking.
12)  
No, we're friendly.
13)  
Could be. Who are you?
14)  
Define "trouble."
15)  LEE
{happyB}No, we're friendly. [hushed] Put your hand down, Ken.
16)  CHRISTA
That's what everybody says.
17)  LEE
{normalD}We know.
18)  LEE
{angryA}Could be. Who are you?
19)  CHRISTA
Two people who have a strategic position on you.
20)  OMID
Come on, hon.
21)  LEE
{thinkingA}Define "trouble."
22)  CHRISTA
Anything that gets you killed or worse and it tends to come hand in hand with groups of guys in distress.
23)  CHRISTA
Did you not hear me?
24)  KENNY
{disgustA}We heard you.
25)  CHUCK
We're not bad folks.
26)  OMID
[quiet, to someone right next to him] Let's give these guys a break.
27)  CHRISTA
[quiet to someone right next to you]We'll see.
28)  OMID
You guys got a problem with your train?
29)  KENNY
{disgustA}Yeah, you're standing right in front of it.
30)  OMID
Dude, it's a wreck. It's not so bad from up here.
31)  OMID
Send your buddy up to have a look.
32)  KENNY
{thinkingA}Anything goes sideways up there, we won't let them escape.
33)  OMID
[intimate talk] {happyB}A group of guys is what we need.
34)  CHRISTA
[intimate talk] {angryA}They're what you think we need. We're doing fine.
35)  OMID
[intimate talk] {thinking}For now. {sadA}What about when?
36)  OMID
[gathering himself] {happyA}Hey dude, I'm Omid.
37)  LEE
{happyA}Lee.
38)  CHRISTA
{angryA}Christa. What's the deal with the train?
39)  LEE
{happyA}We're driving it.
40)  OMID
{happyB}OH, MAN.
41)  
We could use some good people.
42)  
It's been a bad day.
43)  
We're not in the mood for new people.
44)  LEE
{normalD}Look, you want to help us out? We could use some able bodies and... yeah, {sadB}we really need some help.
45)  CHRISTA
{angryA}What's in it--
46)  OMID
[seeing something] {surpriseA}Oh, shit!
47)  LEE
{sadA}I'm not going to bullshit you. {thinkingA}Our group is a little fucked right now. We had a bite victim and then his mom took her life and before that, just... [sigh].
48)  CHRISTA
[sincere]{sadB}It's okay.
49)  LEE
{normalC}We're not really in the meetin' and greetin' mood. {thinkingA}I just came up here to see about the tanker.
50)  CHRISTA
{thinkingA}Well, there it is.
51)  CHRISTA
{thinkingA}That thing does look safe.
52)  OMID
{happyB}And it runs!
53)  CHRISTA
{angryA}I suppose we should--
54)  OMID
[enthusiastic] {happyD}Goddamn, you guys have a kid!
55)  LEE
{thinkingB}What are you doing up here?
56)  OMID
{happyC}Do you know how long it's been since I've seen a kid? Shit! {happyA}What's your name?
57)  CLEMENTINE
{happyB}Clementine.
58)  LEE
[to clementine] {happyA}Oh, so he gets to swear?
59)  OMID
{happyC}Well, this is great. [to his girlfriend] {happyD}See, things are looking up.
60)  CHRISTA
{thinkingA}Hmm. What's your story?
61)  
I found her. I was on my way to jail, day one.
62)  
I've been with her since this all started.
63)  
We've just been trying to get by.
64)  LEE
{thinkingA}I came across Clementine alone the first day all of this happened.
72)  LEE
{thinkingA}I came across Clementine alone the first day all of this happened.
65)  LEE
{thinkingB}I was actually incarcerated.
66)  OMID
{happyA}Sick, do you have any prison tats?
67)  LEE
{normalD}I didn't make it that far.
68)  LEE
{happyA}It's that obvious?
69)  LEE
{thinkingA}And no, he's not down there.
70)  CHRISTA
{angryA}You're not her dad. He down there?
71)  CHRISTA
{angryB}To me.
73)  LEE
{happyA}We've been together ever since.
74)  LEE
{thinkingA}We've just been trying to get by, together. Maybe find her parents.
75)  CHRISTA
{happyB}Hey. I'm Christa.
76)  CLEMENTINE
{happyB}Hi.
77)  CHRISTA
{happyA}Does he not answer questions a lot?
78)  CLEMENTINE
{normalC}Sometimes.
79)  CHRISTA
{normalB}Should we help you guys out?
80)  CLEMENTINE
{fearA}Yes, please.
81)  CHRISTA
{happyA}Okay then.
82)  CHRISTA
{angryA}And everybody down there, they're cool?
83)  
Kenny lost his wife and kid.
84)  
Ben is young and stupid.
85)  
We just met Chuck.
86)  LEE
{thinkingA}What time is it?
87)  OMID
{fearB}Man. {fearB}How long ago.
88)  LEE
{thinkingB}Maybe two hours ago.
89)  LEE
{sadA}Kenny lost his wife and kid.
90)  CHRISTA
{sadB}Goddamn...
91)  OMID
No sweat.
92)  LEE
{thinkingA}I know, we just have to keep an eye on him.
93)  LEE
{sadA}It's been rough for everybody down there. {thinkingA}I'm sure you can say the same.
94)  CHRISTA
{angryA}The first two things you said don't really go with the third.
95)  LEE
{thinkingA}Ben is young and stupid and,{happyA} I think, harmless.
96)  LEE
{thinkingA}We just met Chuck, {happyA}but he seems like an all right guy.
97)  LEE
{normalD}That must've been a long time ago.
98)  CHRISTA
{angryA}You always have to worry about new people.
99)  OMID
{thinking}Used to love meeting new people.
100)  CLEMENTINE
{happyB}They are.
101)  CHRISTA
{happyA}Good.
102)  OMID
{fearA}We're sorry for anything that's happened to you guys.
103)  OMID
{happyB}That train is awesome, though.
104)  OMID
{thinking}You can't just blast through it, I guess.
105)  CHRISTA
{angryA}That tank is your real problem. We'll help you with it, {angryB}but if we see anything we don't like, we're moving on down the road. Alone.
106)  CHRISTA
{thinkingA}If you could get it down, the rest would probably be pretty easy.
107)  LEE
{normalB}We'll start there.
108)  CHRISTA
{normalB}We'll come down and settle in, and see if we can help.
109)  LEE
{happyB}We'd appreciate the help.
110)  OMID
{thinking}I don't know. {sadA}Four?
111)  LEE
{happyA}Guys, this is Omid and Christa.
112)  CHRISTA
{angryA}So says the quiet conductor over here.
113)  OMID
{thinking}Not big on welcomes...
114)  LEE
{happyA}Like I said, we could use some good people.
115)  LEE
{sadA}Like I said, it's been a bit of a day.
116)  LEE
{thinkingA}Like I said, we're not really up for meeting folks.
117)  OMID
{thinking}I get it.
118)  CHRISTA
{angryA}I guess clamming up around new folks is sort of ya'lls thing?
119)  OMID
{surpriseA}We just wanted to say hi {happyA}and say your train is pretty cool.
120)  CHRISTA
{angryA}But we're not looking for charity.
121)  OMID
{surpriseA}We COULD help you guys, though.
122)  CHRISTA
[hmmph] {thinkingA}Maybe.
123)  OMID
{surpriseA}So, yeah... {happyA}hi, {surpriseA}uh, again.
124)  CHUCK
{normalC}Ya'll want some candy?
125)  
We're going to cut that tanker down.
126)  
These two are joining us.
127)  
It's time we move forward.
128)  KENNY
{sadC}Seems like plan enough to me.
129)  LEE
{happyA}The plan is to cut that tanker down. It'll roll down the ravine and we can be on our way.
130)  LEE
{happyA}I don't know what it is, but I can tell you two are good people.
131)  LEE
{normalB}These two are joining us.
132)  CHUCK
{thinkingA}Gotta be careful about newcomers, I say.
133)  CHRISTA
{angryA}We'll see about that.
136)  CHRISTA
{angryA}We'll see about that.
134)  LEE
{normalD}It's time we move forward. {sadA}Omid and Christa are going to help and {normalD}we're gonna get past this damned tanker.
135)  OMID
{happyB}We're happy to stick around.
137)  CHRISTA
{normalB}I'll get to know the girl for a minute, {sadA}if you don't mind.
138)  KENNY
[to omid] {sadC}And why don't I show you how this thing works, in case something happens.
139)  LEE
{thinkingA}Really, Ken?
140)  KENNY
{sadC}It's probably for the best.
141)  OMID
{happyA}Sounds great. Let's do this thing.
142)  OMID
{normalB}You want to start in on that tanker?
143)  LEE
[calling out] {HappyA}{Body-A}I found a blowtorch in the station. {ThinkingA}Should make quick work of the coupling up there.
144)  OMID
{HappyA}{Body-A}Excellent, I'll come up there with you to have a look.
145)  OMID
{DisgustB}Doh...
146)  LEE
{FearB}{Body-A}Just about got it.
147)  LEE
{SadA}Well, fuck.
148)  OMID
{SurpriseA}{Body-A}That is crazy, look at it go. [cutting through a thing with a welding torch]
149)  OMID
That's compressed shit. If there wasn't more where you found the torch, we're boned.
150)  LEE
Think there's any more fuel around?
151)  LEE
{ThinkingB}This thing's hanging by a thread. The smallest cut and it'll go.
152)  BEN
{FearC}WE GOTTA GO!
153)  LEE
[holding omid] {SurpriseB}{Body-A}There must be thousands...
154)  LEE
{FearC}Fuck, Omid! CUT! CUT!
155)  OMID
{SurpriseC}{Body-A}WHAT THE WHAT.
156)  BEN
[yelling] {FearA}{Body-A}Guys... there's something coming.
157)  OMID
{FearB}IT'S GOING! PULL ME UP!
158)  OMID
{FearC}I AM!
159)  LEE
{SurpriseB}{Body-A}KENNY, GO!
160)  LEE
[to omid] {SurpriseA}We gotta jump.
161)  OMID
{Body-A}{FearA}WHAT?! No way!
162)  
Jump!
163)  
Have it your way. [Push him]
164)  
You stay here and we'll go with your lady.
165)  LEE
{AngryA}Fine!
166)  LEE
{AngryC}Jump, DAMMIT!
167)  OMID
{AngryB}Still no!
168)  OMID
[jump!] {Body-A}{FearC}No!
169)  LEE
{Body-A}{FearB}Jump!
170)  LEE
[falling 20 feet] {Body-A}{AngryB}OOF.
177)  LEE
[falling 20 feet] {Body-A}{AngryB}OOF.
171)  OMID
[falling and hurting your leg on the landing] {Body-A}{FearC}AHH!
175)  OMID
[falling and hurting your leg on the landing] {Body-A}{FearC}AHH!
172)  CHRISTA
{Body-A}{FearB}Shit!
176)  CHRISTA
{Body-A}{FearB}Shit!
173)  CHRISTA
{AngryB}RUN!
179)  CHRISTA
{AngryB}RUN!
174)  OMID
[hurt] Oww...
178)  OMID
[hurt] Oww...
180)  OMID
{Body-A}{SurpriseB}I will!
181)  LEE
{Body-A}{DisgustB}Have it your way.
182)  OMID
{FearC}You son of a--!
183)  OMID
{Body-A}{AngryC}The hell you will!
184)  LEE
{Body-A}{DisgustB}Fine, you stay here and we'll go with your lady!
185)  BEN
[far away] {Body-A}{FearB}COME ON!
186)  CHRISTA
[far away] {Body-A}{FearB}GUYS!
187)  LEE
[shoved off a ledge] {Body-A}{FearC}Shi--
188)  OMID
{Body-A}{FearC}It's fucking scary, right?!
189)  OMID
{Body-A}{FearB}SCARIER.
190)  LEE
{normalB}Leads up to that wrecked tanker.
191)  LEE
{Body-A}{thinkingA}This thing is mangled to hell... no releasing it, no nothing.
192)  LEE
{Body-A}{thinkingA}Could I cut through it, maybe? I dunno...
193)  LEE
{Body-A}{ThinkingA}I got this blowtorch...
194)  LEE
{thinkingA}There's no way I'm pulling anything apart down there.
195)  LEE
{normalD}More big shit to move.
196)  LEE
{thinkingA}This would create a hell of a fireball if we tried to blast through.
197)  LEE
{angryA}If I come up there you better not be murderers or thieves.
198)  CHRISTA
{angryA}I guess you'll have to find out.
199)  LEE
{normalB}I guess it's good Clem's got a woman to talk to.
201)  CHRISTA
{angryA}Stop it.
202)  
What were you guys arguing about?
203)  
Where you from?
204)  
Not sure how we'll get that tank down.
205)  LEE
{happyA}Hey there.
206)  CHRISTA
{thinkingA}You got this girl shooting guns?
207)  CHRISTA
{angryA}You weren't getting one. It's good. {happyA}She should be able to take care of herself.
208)  LEE
{thinkingA}Look, I don't need a lecture.
209)  LEE
{happyA}Careful, she's a crack shot now.
210)  LEE
{fearA}Jeez, {normalB}a long way from home.
211)  LEE
{thinkingA}Where you from?
212)  CHRISTA
San Francisco.
213)  CHRISTA
{happyA}I blame the one in there. He wanted the great American road trip.
214)  CHRISTA
{happyA}Wonderful. You two will be thick as thieves.
215)  LEE
{happyB}He got a little more than he bargained for, huh?
216)  CHRISTA
[pickup 2] [new read: - Read well, but strange in context. Maybe if they added 'anyway' to the end of 'history.'] {angryA}Who the hell is into Civil War history anyway? Other than old white guys.
217)  CHRISTA
{angryA}Nothing.
218)  LEE
{thinkingA}If you're going to be around for a while {angryA}it'd be good to know what baggage ya got.
219)  CHRISTA
{angryA}Then maybe we won't be around for a while.
220)  LEE
{thinkingB}What were you two arguing about when I was coming up the ladder?
221)  CHRISTA
{happyA}Maybe ask Omid. He likes to break things.
222)  LEE
{thinkingA}Not sure how we'll get that tank down.
223)  LEE
{happyA}Hi, girls.
224)  CHRISTA
[response to hi] {happyA}Hey.
225)  LEE
GOTCHA.
226)  CHRISTA
Now Omid!
227)  LEE
RUN!
271)  LEE
RUN!
228)  LEE
GRAB MY HAND!
272)  LEE
GRAB MY HAND!
229)  KENNY
{angryB}I said don't touch it, jackass.
230)  KENNY
{sadC}The whole thing's pretty simple, really.
231)  OMID
{thinking}How could it not be?
232)  
Learning the ropes?
233)  
How have you guys made it this far?
235)  
You like Civil War history, huh?
236)  
How long since you've been home?
237)  LEE
{happyB}Talk to you later.
238)  OMID
There are a lot of levers I can't wait to use.
239)  KENNY
{angryA}We'll see.
240)  OMID
Maybe we can drive in shifts?
241)  KENNY
{angryA}I said if something WERE to happen to me.
242)  LEE
{happyA}Learning the ropes? Can't be too hard, right?
243)  OMID
Please. I've saved her ass hundreds...tens...some times.
244)  LEE
{thinkingA}How have you two made it this far? {angryA}You seem dangerously normal.
245)  LEE
[amused] {thinkingA}I got the feeling {happyB}she takes care of you.
246)  OMID
Christa doesn't let us join groups and I'm a fucking scrapper.
247)  OMID
Excellent. Don't tell Christa, though. That won't be as big a selling point for her.
248)  OMID
Well... yeah.
249)  OMID
Fuck yeah.  What do you know about some Quantrill's Raid?
250)  LEE
{happyB}And we're headed the other way. {normalB}But if it's somehow not crawling with the dead, there should be some cool things to see.
251)  LEE
{happyA}It happened about a thousand miles that way.[points]
252)  LEE
{happyA}You got it.
253)  LEE
{happyB}You like Civil War history, huh?
254)  LEE
{happyA}How long since you've been home?
255)  LEE
{normalD}That's rough.
256)  OMID
Like six months. We were on the road for a while and then, you know.
257)  OMID
Our cat is gonna be pissed.
258)  LEE
[ha] {ThinkingA}No, but I'm gonna lower you over the edge.
259)  OMID
{AngryC}The hell you are!
260)  OMID
{Body-A}{DisgustB}You think it'll be within mine?
261)  LEE
{Body-A}{ThinkingB}Here. The weak portion of the coupling is out of my reach.
262)  OMID
{AngryC}{Body-A}God, you're a real son of a bitch, aren't you?
263)  LEE
I found this hacksaw. It might be enough to finish the job.
264)  OMID
Yeah, it might.
265)  LEE
We're almost through down there.
266)  OMID
I'll keep on the lookout for something that could help.
267)  OMID
{Body-A}{HappyD}Fire that thing up.
268)  LEE
{Body-A}{FearA}Think this will work?
269)  OMID
{Body-A}{HappyD}Dude, you're cutting metal with fire. How could it not?
270)  LEE
I gotcha!
273)  OMID
You gotta get Christa!
274)  LEE
Let's go! Come on!
275)  KENNY
{normalB}We'll be down here.
276)  LEE
{happyA}Teaching him anything?
277)  KENNY
{normalB}Trying to...
278)  BEN
Yeah, we're good for a ways.
279)  LEE
{happyA}Got a clear view up there?
280)  BEN
{happyA}Yeah.
281)  LEE
{happyA}As soon as that thing comes down we'll be on our way.
282)  LEE
{thinkingA}And I hope we won't have any more trouble out of you.
283)  BEN
{fearA}I promise you won't.
284)  LEE
She set off any alarm bells?
285)  LEE
You interrogating this woman for us?
286)  CLEMENTINE
Yep.
287)  CHRISTA
[turns to lee] She's very thorough.
288)  CLEMENTINE
[wryly with a smile] Not yet.
289)  LEE
[with a smile] That's what I like to hear.
290)  LEE
Hurry, dammit!!!
291)  LEE
Watch out!
292)  LEE
Dammit!
293)  LEE
{thinkingA}Maybe I should check out that train station.
294)  LEE
{thinkingB}The train station's over there.
295)  LEE
[announces to the group] {happyA}Clementine and I are checking out this train station, all right? Hustle over if you hear anything.
296)  LEE
{happyc}Yeah, all right. Come on.
297)  CLEMENTINE
{fearA}I do. But... it's like we're a team. {happyB}Like you said.
298)  CLEMENTINE
{happyB}Can I follow you over there?
299)  LEE
{happyA}You don't like the new girl?
300)  LEE
{thinkingB}Whatever government work was going on here didn't seem to help.
301)  LEE

302)  OMID

[semi out of breath] {Body-A}{SurpriseA}That... was a LOT... of them.
305)  CLEMENTINE
{Body-HandOnWrist}{FearA}Are you hurt...?
306)  LEE
{Body-A}{HappyA}No, we're okay.
307)  OMID
{AngryB}Speak for yourself, my leg is fucked.

[pickup2] Well, there's all that disaster relief stuff up there.
341)  LEE
[pickup2] {Body-A}{HappyA}It should work now.
342)  LEE
[pickup2] {Body-A}{ThinkingA}Once it's fixed, it should be enough to cut the coupling.
343)  LEE
[pickup2] {Body-A}{DisgustA}Until I patch that hose, it's useless.
344)  LEE
[pickup2] {Body-A}{DisgustB}Hope this holds.
346)  
Give Blowtorch To
347)  OMID
[pickup2] Crap.
426)  OMID
[pickup2] Crap.
348)  LEE
[pickup2] I found some tape. Should be enough to patch it.
349)  OMID
[pickup2] Okay. I'll meet you up there.
350)  KENNY
{angryA}I don't know what that does yet. Don't touch it.
351)  
Careful, she's a crack shot now.
352)  
About what happened in the station...
353)  CHRISTA
{thinkingA}I think it's a good idea -- {fearA}figurin' stuff out for yourself -- {thinkingA}for what it's worth.
354)  CHRISTA
{thinkingA}But be smart about it, though, you know? {happyA}Teach her to scan the area for things. {angryA}You two should never be looking in the same spot -- that's a waste. Stay the hell out of places like that building over there, especially if you don't have more than one way to get out.
355)  CHRISTA
{angryB}And be more afraid of groups of living men than dead folk.
356)  LEE
[pickup2] That, we know.
357)  CHRISTA
Omid and I are still alive because we're two and not six or eight or ten. I don't believe in strength in numbers and you shouldn't either.
358)  LEE
[pickup2] We're trying to get used to being on our own, Clementine and I.
359)  CHRISTA
{thinkingA}So you take her into a dark, boarded up building to build character?
360)  LEE
[pickup2] Not exactly.
361)  BEN
[pickup2] Thank god...
362)  
Get used to them. It's easier.
363)  
No shit. Walkers, man...
364)  
Toughen up.
365)  LEE
[pickup2] Get used to them. I don't think they're going anywhere any time soon.
366)  BEN
[pickup2] Their numbers keep going up, and ours...
367)  BEN
[pickup2] I'm glad somebody else feels that way.
368)  LEE
[pickup2] No shit. Walkers, man. You know, sometimes you might see me take care of one, because I have to, but don't start thinking they don't horrify me.
369)  LEE
[pickup2] Toughen up. It's, you, me and now Chuck. Who knows what these new people have planned.
370)  LEE
[pickup2] There are going to be a lot more walkers to take care of.
371)  BEN
[pickup2] That's what I'm afraid of.
372)  BEN
[pickup2] [Exhale, sigh]
373)  BEN
[pickup2] Yeah, take myself out.
374)  LEE
[pickup2] Don't be dramatic.
375)  LEE
[pickup2] And don't let them get a hold of you.
376)  BEN
[pickup2] I'm telling you, Lee, if they ever get a HOLD of me... and I know I'm not getting out of it...that's it, man. I'm just, gonna... punch my own ticket.
377)  LEE
[pickup2] ...Punch your own ticket?
378)  CHRISTA
{Body-A}{AngryA}AHH! [being pulled]
379)  LEE
[pickup2] {Body-A}{FearA}UGH!
387)  LEE
[pickup2] {Body-A}{FearA}UGH!
380)  CHRISTA
{AngryB}You son of a bitch! Save HIM! [as in "i told you to save HIM not me]
381)  CHRISTA
[bigger] {FearB}OMID!
382)  CHRISTA
Omid!
383)  OMID
[pickup2] {Body-A}{AngryC}No! Her! NOT ME!
384)  OMID
[pickup2] {Body-A}{FearC}CHRISTA NO!!!! FUCK!
385)  OMID
[pickup2] {AngryC}You piece of shit! She's a woman! Don't you know--
386)  OMID
[pickup2] [distraught. thought he lost her] {SadA}Baby.
388)  CHRISTA
{Body-A}{FearA}UGH!
389)  CHRISTA

404)  LEE
[pickup2] {ThinkingB}The hose has a leak in it.
405)  OMID
[pickup2] {SurpriseB}Turn it off, dude! I don't want my eyebrows burned off!
406)  OMID
[pickup2] {FearA}Better plug that leak with something.
407)  CHRISTA
[pickup2][big, astonished, angry] {Body-A}{AngryB}What the hell is wrong with you? Is this how you protect your people?

409)  KENNY
[pickup2] Someone might want to have a look inside of that station back there, too.
410)  LEE
[pickup2][ha] No, but I'm gonna dangle you over that ledge.[this is just a very slight change to what we recorded already, for ref]
411)  LEE
[pickup2] [alt] The plan is to cut that tanker down and be on our way.
412)  LEE
[pickup2] Good thinking.
413)  OMID
[pickup2][alt]  Plus that thing is full of sweet sweet gasoline. We should be sure to siphon some off.
414)  CHRISTA
[pickup2] That's a pretty useful radio for her to be holding onto, no?
415)  CHRISTA
[pickup2] Ah, I understand.
416)  LEE
[pickup2] It's busted, but... it means something to her.
417)  KENNY

[pickup2][context: the escape route is cut off] It's smashed to hell!
424)  OMID
[pickup2] Holy crap!
425)  LEE
[pickup2][disappointed] It's too far off the edge.
427)  LEE
[pickup2][frustrated] Dammit, it was just about done, too.
428)  LEE
[pickup2][disappointed] I can't reach it now.
429)  OMID
[pickup2] No sweat, man.
430)  LEE
[pickup2] Whoa, thanks!
431)  CHRISTA
[pickup2][context: what did I JUST tell you?] Omid....
432)  OMID
[pickup2][playful, what did I do wrong?] What?
433)  OMID
[pickup2][excited] Let's go talk to your people, man!
434)  CHRISTA
[pickup2][context: get the lead out] Am I gonna have to tell your
people the plan or what?
435)  LEE
[pickup2][referring to the train] All this power and we're still stuck.
