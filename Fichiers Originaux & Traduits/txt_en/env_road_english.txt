304)  LEE
{NormalD}This one time, these {AngryA}boys from the other side of town were {DisgustB}hassling him.
305)  LEE
{AngryA}He was on his bike and {SadA}they were in a truck throwing things at him, {NormalD}calling him names; {ThinkingB}stuff like that.
306)  LEE
{HappyC}And this tough son of a gun, {HappyB}he peddles up after them and {NormalD}he catches them. {HappyA}He pulls his bike up alongside the truck {HappyB}and jumps into the back and {FearA}starts beating on 'em.
307)  LEE
{AngryA}Anyway, if he can live {HappyA}through that, {ThinkingA}I'm sure Duck {HappyA}can live through this.
