1)  BEN
{ThinkingA}Is there any way to get around it?
2)  KENNY
{ThinkingA} Doesn't look like it. On foot, maybe. {AngryA}Can't really afford to do that now.
3)  LEE
{NormalC} This seems like a safe area. {ThinkingA}All this brush will stop anything from creeping up on us.
4)  KENNY
{AngryA}And I'd like everyone out of the RV except her. {DisgustA}I don't want folks trapped in there with her.
5)  KENNY
{FearA} Be careful in there.
6)  LEE
{ThinkingA}What, you think there might be something dangerous inside of an abandoned locomotive? [a beat]{HappyA} Hadn't crossed my mind.
7)  KATJAA
{NormalB}Lee, if you come across anything to drink, if there's a dining car or something, I think Duck's a bit dehydrated.
8)  KENNY
{DisgustA}It's a freighter, hon.
9)  BEN
{NormalB} Why don't you and I go look around?
10)  LEE
{NormalB} Yeah, everyone else relax. {HappyA}Clem, stay close to Kenny and Kat, okay?
11)  LEE
{ThinkingA}I hope so, but this looks recently used. {NormalC}Be on the look-out and have your guard up.
12)  LEE
{ThinkingA}Somebody's been livin' in here.
13)  BEN
{NormalB}Yeah, man. {ThinkingA} Shit. {FearB}Think they're gone?
14)  BEN
{SurprisedA}Whoa.
15)  LEE
I think these tracks might lead to the coast. [reading off the map]Route 27, Savannah. That's where Kenny's got us headed.
16)  LEE
A map of where the train goes.
17)  LEE
[curious] A clipboard?
18)  LEE
It's a bunch of papers.
19)  LEE
A bunch of maps about Georgia's cities. Nothing about the train.
20)  LEE
Nothing about the train.
21)  LEE
[curious] Damn. Pages are gone.
22)  LEE
Not much left of it.
23)  LEE
[picking up a gross thing] {DisgustA}Ugh.
24)  LEE
[squinting, not really sure] I can kinda see the indentations from the writing.
25)  LEE
Definitely from this pad.
26)  LEE
A pencil. Sharpened, too.
27)  LILLY
{ThinkingB} I'm leaving.
28)  
GO.
58)  
GO.
29)  
Don't move.
30)  
I'm going to stop you.
31)  LEE
{NormalC} Go. {AngryA} Now.
32)  LILLY
{ThinkingB} I'm not going to hurt you.
36)  LILLY
{ThinkingB} I'm not going to hurt you.
37)  LILLY
{ThinkingB} I'm not going to hurt you.
33)  LEE
{NormalC} Don't move. {AngryC} Don't you fucking move.
34)  LEE
{AngryC} I'm going to stop you.
35)  LILLY
{AngryB} No you're not.
38)  LILLY
{FearA} Come with me.
39)  LILLY
{ThinkingA} We could take the RV right now. He left the keys in it.
40)  
Okay.
41)  
No way.
414)  LEE
No way.
42)  
Come on, Lilly.
43)  LILLY
{ThinkingA} Get Clementine.
44)  LEE
{NormalD} Okay.
45)  LILLY
[nervous tense] {AngryA} Okay.
46)  LEE
{NormalC}[seriously] Yes.
47)  LEE
{ThinkingA} I'll get her and come right back.
48)  LILLY
{FearA} Seriously?
49)  LILLY
{ThinkingB} You're not letting me take it.
50)  LILLY
{SadA} I didn't think you would say yes.
51)  LEE
{NormalC} I can't let you take the RV. {ThinkingB} Don't be crazy.
52)  LILLY
{SadB} I'm sorry, Lee. I really am.
53)  LEE
{AngryC} No way.
54)  LEE
{NormalD} Come on, Lilly...
55)  LILLY
{AngryA} I know you did what you did for a reason and {SadA} part of me understands. {AngryA} But the other part sees you with your back turned to me and knows {AngryB} I could've killed you.
56)  LILLY
{ThinkingB} I could've killed you. I had you while you were {AngryB} rummaging around in the front there.
57)  LILLY
{ThinkingB} I need to go.
59)  
I'll kill you before that happens.
60)  
Please, don't.
61)  LEE
Perfect.
62)  LEE
[seeing an impressive zombie killing weapon] Rusted shut, but nice and heavy.
63)  LEE
[seeing an impressive zombie killing weapon] Nice.
118)  LEE
[seeing an impressive zombie killing weapon] Nice.
64)  LEE
[seeing an impressive zombie killing weapon] That'll crack a skull just fine.
65)  BEN
Push it!
66)  LEE
Are you fucking serious?
67)  KENNY
This fucker WORKS?
68)  LEE
Seems like it.
69)  BEN
It's just the brakes.
70)  BEN
Why not?
71)  LEE
I don't know, ask Mister Amtrak over here.
72)  LEE
Okay, I'll give you that one.
73)  BEN
Here, look.
74)  LEE
That light is blinking.
75)  LEE
[disbelief] Push it?
76)  KENNY
I'll be damned. How the hell do we get it movin'?
77)  BEN
No clue.
78)  KENNY
{HappyA} Well, let's look around. Maybe it goes somewhere we'd like to be.
79)  LILLY
{AngryA} Then what's it like?
80)  LILLY
{SadA} I'm sitting here, tied up like an animal while you guys decide what to do with me.
81)  LEE
{NormalD} It's not like that.
82)  LEE
{NormalD} Hey, Lilly.
83)  LEE
{NormalC} Lilly...
84)  LEE
{NormalD} [context: Say something to me] Lilly...
85)  CHUCK
{angryb}You touch any of my stuff?
86)  
I took the map of the train routes.
87)  
I took a bottle of water.
88)  
This is your stuff?
89)  CHUCK
{normalC}Yeah, I got ‘em all up here.
90)  LEE
{normalC}I took the map of the train routes.
91)  LEE
{thinkingA}Really?
95)  LEE
{thinkingA}Really?
92)  CHUCK
{normalb}That's fine, you can have that.
94)  CHUCK
{normalb}That's fine, you can have that.
93)  CHUCK
{normalA}Yeah, I got plenty and ya'll are probably thirsty.
96)  CHUCK
{angryA}Sure is.
97)  LEE
{thinkingA}This is your stuff?
98)  
I didn't take anything.
99)  CHUCK
{thinkingA}I asked if you touched it.
100)  LEE
{normalC}I didn't take anything.
101)  LEE
{angryA}I didn't.
102)  
Who are you?
103)  CHUCK
{thinkingA}The guy who owns that stuff.
104)  LEE
{thinkingA}Who are you?
105)  CHUCK
{thinkingA}Nothin'? Ain't no fear in you, boy.
106)  CHUCK
{normalb}I guess it's no worse for wear.
107)  LEE
{normalA}Yeah.
108)  CHUCK
{normalC}[softens] Name's Chuck. Charles if you're fancy.
109)  CHUCK
{normalA}That your crew outside?
110)  LEE
{normalA}Lee.
111)  LEE
{normalA}Him too.
112)  CHUCK
{normalA}And the guy up in the cab?
113)  LEE
{thinkingA}What?
114)  LEE
You're still kinda freaking me out.
115)  CHUCK
{normalC}I saw you walking through here and thought about scaring the pants off of you.
116)  CHUCK
{happyA}But I couldn't force myself to do it.
117)  CHUCK
{normalC}Train folk'll do that. {happyA}Already met everyone outside; they all warmed to me right quick in direct sunlight.
119)  LEE
Looks unopened.
120)  LEE
I'll take this to Katjaa for Duck.
121)  KENNY
Holy shit she's stealing the RV!
138)  KENNY
Holy shit she's stealing the RV!
753)  KENNY
Holy shit she's stealing the RV!
756)  KENNY
Holy shit she's stealing the RV!
122)  KENNY
Come back here you crazy bitch!
136)  KENNY
Come back here you crazy bitch!
754)  KENNY
Come back here you crazy bitch!
757)  KENNY
Come back here you crazy bitch!
123)  KENNY
FUCK! STOP!
137)  KENNY
FUCK! STOP!
755)  KENNY
FUCK! STOP!
758)  KENNY
FUCK! STOP!
124)  
I'm glad she's gone.
125)  
We're fucked.
126)  
Let's focus on the train.
127)  KENNY
{AngryB} With our only reliable vehicle!
128)  LEE
{AngryB} I'm glad she's gone.
129)  LEE
{ThinkingB} Maybe, man. Maybe.
734)  LEE
{ThinkingB} Maybe, man. Maybe.
735)  LEE
{ThinkingB} Maybe, man. Maybe.
130)  LEE
{AngryB} We're fucked.
131)  KENNY
{AngryB} Yeah we are. [fucked]
132)  LEE
{ThinkingA} Let's focus on the train.
133)  KENNY
{SadA} The hell we do now?!
134)  KENNY
[through grit teeth] {AngryA} Duck is still sick, you know. We need to get to the city. The coast.
135)  KENNY
{AngryB} Well, we're fucked if we don't figure out how this thing works. {SadA} We can't spend the night out here.
139)  KENNY
{HappyC} Holy shit, we're golden!
140)  
Duck though...
141)  
Yeah we are.
142)  
This thing is loud.
143)  LEE
{SadB} Look, Kenny, it's something {ThinkingA} we're going to have to deal with.
144)  KENNY
{AngryA}What about him?
145)  KENNY
{HappyA}Let's fucking enjoy this.
146)  KENNY
{ThinkingA}Did you not hear Kat? {AngryB} We don't know shit, Lee.
147)  LEE
{SadA}What about Duck?
148)  LEE
{HappyC} Yeah, we are. Golden. {HappyB} Man, feels good.
149)  LEE
{FearA} This thing is loud.
150)  KENNY
{ThinkingA}So what? {AngryA}We're barrelling down the tracks at forty miles an hour. {HappyA}I don't care about the noise.
151)  KENNY
{HappyB}Finally. {SadA}Something.
152)  KENNY
This hoss will take us right to Savannah. A hundred tons of steel. Put a thousand walkers between us and the ocean and we don't have to give a shit!
153)  LEE
{HappyA} I think so.
154)  KENNY
{SurprisedA} Whoa, {HappyA} is this what it looks like?
155)  LEE
{NormalB} We found this in the boxcar back there.
156)  KENNY
{ThinkingA} I can't believe it...
157)  KENNY
{ThinkingA} These tracks lead right to Savannah...
158)  KENNY
{NormalA} Holy hell.. {ThinkingA} can you guys see about moving that thing? {HappyB} We could have something here.
159)  LEE
{NormalB} Yeah, we're on it.
160)  
Was it you?
161)  BEN
{AngryA} [emphatic] NO.
162)  LEE
{NormalC} Okay, then.
163)  LEE
{AngryB} Was it?
164)  LEE
{NormalC} Was it you?
165)  BEN
{ThinkingB} Not this again...
166)  
What would you have done with Lilly?
167)  BEN
{ThinkingA} Yeah, but not like that.
168)  BEN
{FearA} I don't know. Left her. {SadA} I've never seen anybody kill someone like that before.
169)  LEE
{SadA} What would you have done with Lilly?
170)  LEE
{ThinkingA} You've seen a bunch of other stuff by now.
171)  
Happy you stayed with us all this time?
172)  BEN
{FearA} It's with you guys or dead. {ThinkingA} I woulda died out there in the woods,{SadA}  just like my classmates.
173)  LEE
{ThinkingB} You think this is better?
174)  LEE
{NormalB} You happy you stayed with us all this time?
175)  BEN
{FearB} Yeah, of course.
176)  LEE
{ThinkingA} Really?
177)  BEN
{NormalC} Yeah.
178)  LEE
{NormalC} Keep it down, I don't want you scaring the kids.
179)  LEE
{ThinkingA} Have you heard or seen anything out here?
180)  BEN
{FearA} No sign of whatever lives in the train.
181)  BEN
{AngryA} I'm watching the girls and not working on a {NormalB}  mega-cool train. {ThinkingB} What do you think? [bummed]
182)  LEE
{NormalB} How ya doing, Ben?
183)  LEE
{NormalD} We did that and it was ruined.
184)  BEN
{NormalB} Well, I'm sure you guys will figure it out.
185)  BEN
{ThinkingB} I guess find the torn off page?
186)  LEE
{NormalB} We found a notebook that we think might've had some starter directions on it {ThinkingB} but the page is missing.
187)  KENNY
{NormalB} Want a ride?
188)  KENNY
{ThinkingA} We don't got much left, so just gather whatever you have.
189)  KENNY
{AngryA} Let me look at him.
190)  CHUCK
{ThinkingA} Well, it sounds like you're taking my home.
191)  CLEMENTINE
{SadC} Duck's sick.
192)  KENNY
{AngryA} That's a yes then.
193)  CHUCK
{ThinkingB} Haven't found anything better for keeping the creepy-crawlies out than that boxcar.
194)  KATJAA
{SadA} He is getting sicker.
195)  KENNY
{AngryB} Get on the train, Clementine.
196)  
Is the train really a good idea?
197)  
We can keep going if you want.
198)  
We can't ignore this.
199)  KENNY
{AngryB} YES. {SadA} What can we do here?
200)  KENNY
{AngryC} It's TALKED THROUGH. {AngryA} Get on, Kat.
207)  KENNY
{AngryC} It's TALKED THROUGH. {AngryA} Get on, Kat.
210)  KENNY
{AngryC} It's TALKED THROUGH. {AngryA} Get on, Kat.
218)  KENNY
{AngryC} It's TALKED THROUGH. {AngryA} Get on, Kat.
201)  KENNY
{AngryB} We get on the train and we find something better. THAT is the plan.
211)  KENNY
{AngryB} We get on the train and we find something better. THAT is the plan.
202)  KATJAA
{ThinkingA} I think Lee just wants to talk it through.
206)  KATJAA
{ThinkingA} I think Lee just wants to talk it through.
212)  KATJAA
{ThinkingA} I think Lee just wants to talk it through.
203)  LEE
{ThinkingB} Is the train really a good idea, with Duck like that... {NormalD} maybe we should focus on one thing at a time.
204)  KENNY
{AngryA} Damn right I want. That's what we're doing.
205)  LEE
{NormalD} We can keep going if you want.
208)  LEE
{NormalD}We can't ignore this. Look at the kid, Kenny. {SadA} This is happening.
209)  KENNY
{AngryB} Ain't shit happening. And if it were, {SadA} what can we do here?
213)  KATJAA
{SadA} I'm worried about him, Kenny.
214)  KENNY
{SadA} So am I. {NormalB} But he'll be fine. Let's go.
215)  KENNY
{AngryA} I don't want you making a big deal out of a scratch. He'll be fine.
216)  KATJAA
[worried]{SadB}  I don't know...
217)  KATJAA
{ThinkingA} Maybe we can just talk it through?
219)  LEE
{ThinkingA} Is that right?
220)  KATJAA
{HappyA}Ah, thank you, perfect.
221)  LEE
{HappyA} Here, I found some water.
222)  KATJAA
{ThinkingA} It's all I can keep thinking about. [hushes her voice] {SadB} Like somehow that matters.
223)  LEE
It doesn't.
224)  KATJAA
{NormalB} He's allergic to bees.
225)  KATJAA
{NormalC} I know. Well, I don't. {FearA} But you're probably right.
226)  CLEMENTINE
{HappyA}He gave us candy. Ben, too!
227)  LEE
{ThinkingA} Yeah... I did.
228)  CLEMENTINE
{HappyB} You met Chuck!
229)  KATJAA
{HappyC} It's so nice to meet someone normal for a change.
230)  
Welcome.
231)  
What's your game, man?
232)  
You have candy?
233)  CHUCK
{HappyC} Thank ya.
234)  CHUCK
{HappyB} Sure did. Man shares my love of the road.
248)  CHUCK
{HappyB} Sure did. Man shares my love of the road.
747)  CHUCK
{HappyB} Sure did. Man shares my love of the road.
749)  CHUCK
{HappyB} Sure did. Man shares my love of the road.
235)  LEE
{ThinkingA} You met Kenny?
745)  LEE
{ThinkingA} You met Kenny?
748)  LEE
{ThinkingA} You met Kenny?
236)  LEE
{NormalB} Welcome.
237)  LEE
{NormalB} That's for certain.
247)  LEE
{NormalB} That's for certain.
746)  LEE
{NormalB} That's for certain.
750)  LEE
{NormalB} That's for certain.
238)  LEE
{NormalB} That's not bad.
239)  CHUCK
{HappyB} I like it.
240)  CHUCK
{ThinkingB} Keepin' alive.
241)  LEE
{ThinkingB} What's your game, man?
242)  CHUCK
{HappyA} Boy got the last piece I had on me.
243)  LEE
{NormalC} Figures.
244)  LEE
{ThinkingB} You have candy?
245)  KATJAA
{AngryA} Don't intimidate the man. {HappyB} He's nice. We need nice.
246)  KATJAA
{NormalC} Kenny is on board. He talked to him.
249)  CHUCK
{HappyA} Sure do!{HappyC} And boy do I have some stories.
250)  CHUCK
{HappyA} Of course, I'll be happy to join you. Til then, {HappyB} I suppose I oughta get to know ya'll.
251)  CHUCK
{ThinkingB} I hear you guys are trying to get her runnin'. {HappyA} Good luck.{ThinkingA}  I flipped switches for a week doin' the same.
252)  CLEMENTINE
You live on a train?
253)  KENNY
{NormalB} It's fine. Radiator could use a rest as it is.
254)  LEE
{NormalB} Hey man, we're still looking around {ThinkingA} and haven't figured much out yet.
255)  LEE
{ThinkingA} You worried about keeping her in there?
256)  KENNY
{HappyB} I cracked a window. [sarc]{AngryA} I sure as hell don't want her out here with us.
257)  KENNY
{NormalB}What's up.
258)  LEE
{NormalB} Hey, Ken.
259)  
I hope you're okay about bringing Lilly.
260)  
I don't know about leaving Lilly back there.
261)  
I'm sorry about the RV.
294)  
I'm sorry about the RV.
310)  LEE
I'm sorry about the RV.
262)  
You want to talk about Duck?
263)  
We need something to help us get the train going.
264)  
I'm working on starting this thing.
265)  KENNY
[sideways glance] {ThinkingA} Turning over a new leaf, huh?
266)  KENNY
{NormalC}It's fine for now, but we have to deal with it eventually.
267)  LEE
{NormalD} I hope it's all right I chose to keep Lilly with us.
268)  LEE
{NormalC} I'm just doing what I can.
269)  LEE
{NormalC} Abandoning someone on the side of the road is the same as murder.
270)  LEE
{NormalD} I don't know about leaving Lilly back there.
271)  KENNY
[sideways glance] {ThinkingA}Don't worry about it.
272)  KENNY
{NormalC}We just would've had to deal with her eventually.
273)  LEE
{SadA} I'm sorry about the RV.{ThinkingB} Keeping her was my call. This one's on me.
274)  KENNY
{ThinkingA} The radiator is fucking hosed in that thing, so {HappyA} she won't make it thirty miles. {ThinkingA}We figure this train out, {HappyB} maybe it turns out she did us a favor.
275)  LEE
{NormalD} You want to talk about Duck? {SadA} I'm really sorry, Kenny. Nobody deserves this.
276)  KENNY
{NormalC} There's nothing to talk about. You heard Kat, he could be fine.
277)  KENNY
{AngryB}Nobody's ignoring nothin'. {NormalC}I'm not worried, you shouldn't be either.
278)  LEE
{SadB} We probably shouldn't ignore...
279)  LEE
{ThinkingB}God, we need some help getting this train going.
280)  KENNY
{NormalC} People take notes, right, when working on stuff like this? [sigh] {ThinkingA} We're smart guys, we can figure it out.
281)  KENNY
{NormalB} We'll find out. {ThinkingA} You mess around in the engine compartment yet?
282)  LEE
{NormalB} With the directions I was able to piece together,{HappyA} I think I might be able to get this thing started. {ThinkingA} I don't know. It's a long-shot. {ThinkingB} I don't even know what the fuel situation is with this thing.
283)  KENNY
{NormalC} I like him fine.
284)  KENNY
{HappyA} Got a good sense about him, yeah. {ThinkingA} Why, you not a fan?
285)  LEE
{ThinkingB} It was just weird to come up on a guy like that, I guess.
286)  LEE
{ThinkingA} You think Chuck is a stand up guy?
287)  LEE
{NormalB} I'll get back to it.
288)  KENNY
{NormalB} Me too.
289)  LEE
{NormalB} All right, then.
290)  KENNY
{NormalB} Yep.
291)  
How's Duck?
297)  LEE
How's Duck?
292)  
Hear anything out of Lilly in there?
293)  
Would you have left Lilly?
295)  
Has Clementine said anything?
296)  KATJAA
Exactly.
298)  LEE
Yeah. His body is probably fighting whatever is in it.
299)  KATJAA
I don't know. Tired. Which could mean a lot of things, right?
300)  LEE
Have you heard anything out of Lilly in there?
301)  KATJAA
She's probably in shock. She did a monstrous thing.
302)  KATJAA
Not a peep.
303)  LEE
I don't like that.
304)  LEE
Okay then.
305)  LEE
Would you have left Lilly back there? On the side of the road like that...
306)  KATJAA
We have to have lines. Yes. I would've left her.
307)  KATJAA
Yes, Lee.
308)  LEE
Yeah?
309)  LEE
Well, we're putting some time into this train and, worse comes to worst, the boxcar's safe enough to sleep in.
311)  KATJAA
I'm worried. We're really on our own out here now.
312)  KATJAA
She's so smart, though.
313)  LEE
Has Clementine said anything to you about Duck, or Lilly or anything? I'm worried about her.
314)  LEE
Yeah, she is.
671)  LEE
Yeah, she is.
315)  KATJAA
No. [sigh] That little girl is a puzzle.
672)  KATJAA
No. [sigh] That little girl is a puzzle.
316)  LEE
Anyway, let me know if anything changes here.
317)  LEE
I better get back to it.
318)  
What about Duck?
319)  
I wouldn't mind plowing through some walkers.
320)  LEE
{ThinkingA} We just have to figure out how to get it started.
321)  KENNY
{HappyA} I'm sure we can figure it out. {NormalB} How tough can it be?
454)  KENNY
{HappyA} I'm sure we can figure it out. {NormalB} How tough can it be?
644)  KENNY
{HappyA} I'm sure we can figure it out. {NormalB} How tough can it be?
322)  LEE
{NormalD} Doug would've known. But {ThinkingA} we'll figure it out.
323)  LEE
{NormalB} No idea, but we'll find out.
324)  KENNY
{HappyB} That's the spirit.
332)  KENNY
{HappyB} That's the spirit.
457)  KENNY
{HappyB} That's the spirit.
460)  KENNY
{HappyB} That's the spirit.
463)  KENNY
{HappyB} That's the spirit.
325)  KENNY
{AngryB} We can't act like he's dead either.
326)  KENNY
{AngryA} What about him?
327)  LEE
{NormalD} Okay. Fair enough. [solemn]
328)  LEE
{HappyA} Ha, I don't know about that.
459)  LEE
{HappyA} Ha, I don't know about that.
329)  KENNY
{NormalB} Try to get this thing started. There's gotta be some {ThinkingA} sort of... manual or somethin'.
335)  KENNY
{NormalB} Try to get this thing started. There's gotta be some {ThinkingA} sort of... manual or somethin'.
458)  KENNY
{NormalB} Try to get this thing started. There's gotta be some {ThinkingA} sort of... manual or somethin'.
330)  LEE
{SadA} We can't act like nothin' happened to him.
331)  LEE
{NormalD} What about Duck?
333)  LEE
{HappyA} I wouldn't mind plowing through some walkers.
334)  KENNY
{ThinkingA} Look....
336)  KENNY
{AngryA} Don't give me any shit.
465)  KENNY
{AngryA} Don't give me any shit.
467)  KENNY
{AngryA} Don't give me any shit.
337)  KENNY
Ben, if you could keep an eye on the girls and Duck, I'd appreciate it. I'm going to make sense of these controls.
338)  KENNY
Man, this could be exactly what we need.
339)  LEE
[hushed] Walker. Sitting in the chair. We got ‘im.
340)  LEE
[hushed] We got one.
341)  LEE
[exhale, relief]
343)  BEN
[exhale, relief]
342)  LEE
Suppose we ought to look him over.
344)  BEN
Yeah.
402)  LEE
Yeah.
345)  LEE
[exertion, lifting a body] Urrrgh...
346)  BEN
[exertion, lifting a body] Urrgh...
347)  KENNY
{AngryA} I'll be up front. I don't want to hear any nonsense until we get where we're goin'.
348)  LEE
Hey, Clem.
349)  CLEMENTINE
{NormalA}What are you going to do with Lilly?
350)  
I don't know.
351)  
Punish her, somehow.
352)  
Nothing.
353)  LEE
I don't know. Something, I suppose. I don't know what we can do.
354)  LEE
Punish her, somehow. She did a terrible thing.
355)  CLEMENTINE
We could lock her away forever.
356)  LEE
[hah] I don't know about that one, hon.
357)  LEE
There's nothing to do that would even begin to fit the crime.
358)  LEE
Yeah. It's horrible.
361)  LEE
Yeah. It's horrible.
359)  CLEMENTINE
She killed him.
360)  CLEMENTINE
She killed her.
362)  LEE
Hey, sweet pea.
363)  CLEMENTINE
I don't think Duck feels good.
364)  LEE
Hey, sweet pea. You okay out here?
365)  LEE
Me, neither.
366)  LEE
That candy Chuck gave you... it taste okay?
367)  CLEMENTINE
It was really good.
368)  LEE
The train's cool, huh?
369)  CLEMENTINE
I guess. Scary, kind of.
370)  LEE
No funny aftertaste?
371)  CLEMENTINE
[why would it?] No.
372)  CLEMENTINE
Oh. Well if you don't end up using it, I'd take it. I like to put leaves between the pages and color over them.
373)  CLEMENTINE
No. I wish. Maybe in the RV? What do you need it for?
660)  CLEMENTINE
No. I wish. Maybe in the RV? What do you need it for?
374)  LEE
There used to be something written on the notepad that I need to know about.
661)  LEE
There used to be something written on the notepad that I need to know about.
375)  LEE
There's a notepad on the train. Do you have any pencils or anything in your pack?
662)  LEE
There's a notepad on the train. Do you have any pencils or anything in your pack?
376)  CLEMENTINE
Yeah, it's fun.
377)  LEE
Like, make a rubbing?
378)  LEE
Hey, Chuck.
379)  CHUCK
Howdy.
380)  
Where are you from?
381)  
Why are you alone?
385)  LEE
Why are you alone?
382)  CHUCK
Georgia boy. You saw where I live.
383)  LEE
Where are you from? You live around here?
384)  CHUCK
Eh, you still got a couple kids and this one's got a good spirit.
386)  CHUCK
I'm sorry; I do like being around you all, actually. It's nice.
387)  CHUCK
That's some kinda something.
388)  LEE
You caught us on a bad day.
389)  LEE
Fine, then.
390)  CHUCK
Why not? Seem to be doin' all right.
391)  LEE
I'll talk to you later.
392)  CHUCK
Hope so.
393)  LEE
[surprised, a zombie just woke up right near you] Jesus!
394)  LEE
Yeah. Should be able to just follow the steps to get the engine on.
752)  LEE
Yeah. Should be able to just follow the steps to get the engine on.
395)  KENNY
You can read it now?
396)  KENNY
It's all yours.
397)  LEE
{NormalB} We got a problem.
398)  KENNY
[context: someone telling you he's found a problem] {ThinkingA} What?
399)  LEE
{ThinkingB}We still got the rest of the train attached to us back there.
400)  KENNY
Damn it!
401)  KENNY
[context: I'm an idiot] Of course, we're still attached.
403)  KENNY
Can you go find out where we're stuck, and get us UN-stuck?
404)  LEE
That's the throttle.
405)  LEE
Looks like it'll get that pin out.
406)  LEE
[straining against a stuck lever] Urrggh...
589)  LEE
[straining against a stuck lever] Urrggh...
592)  LEE
[straining against a stuck lever] Urrggh...
407)  LEE
It's stuck.
588)  LEE
It's stuck.
593)  LEE
It's stuck.
408)  LEE
That's definitely what's got us stuck.
409)  LEE
There's got to be a better way to do this.
410)  KENNY
{ThinkingA} So that's it? We're cut loose?
411)  LEE
{NormalB} Seems that way, yeah.
412)  KENNY
[excited to get a move on] {HappyB} Great.
413)  LEE
The kids might like those.
415)  KENNY
Sounds good.
761)  KENNY
Sounds good.
416)  LEE
[context: bad idea] Too loud.
417)  LEE
He's pinned in there good.
418)  LEE
I thought those things were designed to save lives.
419)  LEE
[frustrated] I can't get at him in there.
713)  LEE
[frustrated] I can't get at him in there.
716)  LEE
[frustrated] I can't get at him in there.
420)  LEE
[smashing a zombie head] RRAAHH!
421)  LEE
[context: hell no] Not without a silent way to kill him.
422)  LEE
[zombie biting you, you die] Auuugh!
423)  LEE
[unsure] {NormalB} Here.  I found these... {NormalD}if Duck's up for it.
424)  KATJAA
{HappyB} Thank you, that's very thoughtful.
425)  LEE
[confused] {ThinkingB} What?
426)  KATJAA
[sincere] {NormalB}Thank you, Lee.
427)  KATJAA
No. {HappyA} The most trouble I ever have is making him use a fork.
428)  KATJAA
{NormalB} Most kids, they're really fussy about what they'll eat. Hate vegetables, that kind of thing.
429)  LEE
{NormalD}Sure.
430)  KATJAA
{SadA}He isn't fussy, you know?
431)  LEE
{HappyA} Not Duck huh?
432)  LEE
{thinkingB} I tried to yank the pin out, but it won't budge.
433)  KENNY
{AngryA}Shit.
434)  KENNY
Can you go see if you can get us UN-stuck?
435)  KENNY
[frustrated] {ThinkingA} Well, we ain't going anywhere until it does.
436)  CHUCK
[to Lee] {NormalB} Your friend mentioned Savannah. {ThinkingA} That where y'all are going?
437)  CHUCK
{HappyB} Have a look.
438)  LEE
{NormalB}Trying to.
439)  CHUCK
{HappyB} Yep.
440)  LEE
[reading off a map] {HappyA} Route 27 will get us straight there.
441)  LEE
{HappyA} I should go show Kenny.
442)  KATJAA
{HappyA} To Savannah?
443)  CHUCK
{HappyC} Yup.
444)  KENNY
{NormalA}Let's get this thing moved and get back on the road.
445)  KENNY
[concerned] {AngryA} I think we're all chompin' at the bit to get moving, {FearA}but we should know where it goes.
446)  LEE
{NormalC}Yeah, we don't want to end up circling back to somewhere like Atlanta.
447)  KENNY
{ThinkingA} They wouldn't drive blind, would they? I didn't see anything in the cab though.
448)  LEE
{NormalB} I'll have a look around.
449)  
We just have to figure out how to get it started.
450)  
We just need to figure out the controls.
451)  
We just need to detatch that back car.
452)  KENNY
{HappyB}C'mon, let's see if she'll move.
455)  KENNY
{HappyB}C'mon, let's see if she'll move.
456)  KENNY
{HappyB}C'mon, let's see if she'll move.
453)  LEE
{ThinkingB} We just need to detatch that back car.
461)  KENNY
{ThinkingA} Once we figure out how to get loose, everything will be all right.
462)  KENNY
{ThinkingA} Once we figure out how to get loose, everything will be all right.
464)  KENNY
{NormalB} Let's just get this thing going.
466)  KENNY
{NormalB} Just get us unstuck.
468)  KENNY
Whatever you just did killed the lights up here.
469)  LEE
[frustrated] Damn. Okay.
470)  KENNY
Nope, the lights are off again.
471)  LEE
[frustrated] Ugh. Okay.
472)  KENNY
(The lights are) Off again.
473)  KENNY
Nope. Back it up.
474)  LEE
So far so good.
475)  KENNY
[excited] Son of a bitch! Whatever you did lit the dash up!
476)  KATJAA
Ken took off in a hurry.
477)  LEE
You're right.
478)  KATJAA
How?
479)  LEE
I... have no idea.
480)  KATJAA
Well SOMEONE must have known, right?
481)  LEE
We think the train might actually work. I'm trying to find out how to start the engine.
482)  LEE
Same thing... sort of. I found some instructions, but I can't read them.
483)  KATJAA
Oh, well, I'm sure someone can help you.
484)  KATJAA
Is Ken all right? What is he doing?
485)  LEE
He's put his mind to figuring out the train.
486)  KATJAA
What about you?
487)  LEE
{NormalC} Yeah, well, he isn't talking.
488)  BEN
{NormalC} That guy in the cab probably knew.
489)  LEE
{ThinkingB} I've got no idea how to get the engine started.
490)  BEN
{ThinkingA} Well, HE had to learn it somewhere.
491)  KENNY
{ThinkingA} You're asking ME? What do I know about a train?
492)  LEE
{NormalD} More than me.
493)  LEE
{NormalC} I can't get us free. {ThinkingA} Any ideas?
494)  KENNY
{NormalC} Sorry, man.
495)  LEE
Shit, this is it. Instructions on starting the engine.
496)  LEE
The door to the boxcar.
497)  LEE
I can get in over there.
498)  LEE
Leads out of this boxcar.
499)  LEE
Might be something inside.
500)  LEE
Might be something inside.
501)  LEE

590)  LEE
[pickup2][straining to move a stuck thing] Urgh.
595)  LEE
[pickup2][straining to move a stuck thing] Urgh.
508)  CHUCK
{SadA} I'm awfully sorry your son's not feeling good.
509)  KATJAA
{HappyB} I appreciate your concern. [warm]
510)  CHUCK
{HappyA} Well, with a little TLC I'm sure he'll be fit as a fiddle in no time.
511)  CHUCK
{HappyC} And I can offer ya'll whatever I got, {NormalA} although it ain't much.
512)  KATJAA
{HappyC} Thank you... we'd like to do the same.
513)  KENNY
{ThinkingA} Why don't we hold off on...
514)  KATJAA
[ignoring kenny] {NormalB} Stay with us, {HappyA} we'd like the company.

[pickup2] I have no idea what to do with these.
646)  LEE
[pickup2] [a futile attempt to start an engine] Nothing.
647)  LEE
[pickup2] Could be the engine switch.
648)  LEE
[pickup2] Doesn't look like the engine has any power.

[pickup2] I took a bottle of water.
653)  LEE
[pickup2] A switch.
663)  CLEMENTINE
[pickup2] Well, if you're not using it, I'd take it. I'm out of paper and there's all sorts of new leaves around here.
664)  LEE
[pickup2] It's an old firepit. It's mostly dirt now.
665)  LEE
[pickup2] It's mostly dirt now, though. Nothing of use.
666)  LEE
[pickup2] I can definitely pry this thing free if I can break it loose first.
667)  LEE
[pickup2] We need a bunch of force to break away all this rust and whatnot before I can pry anything free.

[pickup2] I don't know. [heavy]

[pickup2] Poor Carley.[overwhelmed] God. Where did yesterday go?

I'm fine.

I'm fine.

I was.

688)  KATJAA
[pickup2] I'm sorry.
700)  KATJAA
[pickup2] I'm sorry.
689)  KATJAA
[pickup2] You were standing right there... are you doing okay?
691)  
I was. It was horrible.
694)  KATJAA
[pickup2] I'm sorry you, and, my God, Clementine, had to see that.
695)  LEE
[pickup2] I was. It was awful -- one of the worst things I've seen yet.
