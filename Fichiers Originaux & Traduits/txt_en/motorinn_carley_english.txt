1)  CARLEY
{normalA}What I wanted to say was, {happyA}I've been thinking a lot. {happyb}About you.
2)  
I think about you too.
3)  
What about?
4)  
I'm fine.
5)  LEE
{happya}I think about you too.
6)  CARLEY
{happya}[nervously smitten, just a touch] Our group is small.
7)  LEE
[pickup 2] [new read note: This could be more flirty. As is, it's a bit flat.] {happyb}[flirting "our group is small"]You're small.
8)  LEE
{normalA}What about?
9)  LEE
{normalD}I'm fine.
10)  CARLEY
{thinkingA}Don't brood. I know you're "fine."
11)  LEE
{AngryA}Carley, Jesus...
12)  CARLEY
{normalC}People need to know because we're hanging by a {sadA}thread here and I can't see Lilly talk about you without thinking it's the next thing she's gonna say.
13)  CARLEY
{normalB}You're a convicted killer.
14)  CARLEY
{normalC}[stepping closer] And I think people should know.
15)  CARLEY
{sadA}Not because they deserve to and not because you're a bad man. {normalA}I think the opposite of those two things.
16)  
It's a lifetime ago.
17)  
You're probably right.
18)  
Forget it.
19)  LEE
{sadA}It was a lifetime ago.
20)  CARLEY
{angryA}Which is only going to make the feeling that you hid it and that there was even more to hide that much worse.
21)  LEE
{angrya}[sigh]
22)  LEE
{normald}You're probably right.
23)  CARLEY
{happyb}[flirty] Of course I'm probably right.
24)  LEE
{normalC}Forget it. I have. You should too.
25)  CARLEY
{angryA}God, I hate it when you do that. Don't you hear what I'm saying?
26)  CARLEY
{angrya}[Frustrated] Larry's gone, but he knew. If he didn't tell Lilly outright, he probably said enough to make her wonder.
27)  CARLEY
{normalB}And I know you told Kenny we met in your parent's drugstore, even though the first thing I ever said to you was keep a damn lid on it.
28)  CARLEY
{normalB}I'll tell you what I would tell anybody, apocalypse or not -- there comes a time when you can get out ahead of something like this and discuss it on your terms.
29)  CARLEY
{sadA}Do it before that chance is taken away.
30)  CARLEY
{normalb}People might be pissed. {normalC}And telling them might cause some trouble, but it will be a far cry from what'll happen if they don't hear it from you.
31)  LEE
{normalD}Yeah.
32)  CARLEY
{normalB}So you'll do it then?
33)  
I'll let people know.
34)  
No.
35)  LEE
{thinkingA}I'll let people know. {NormalB}You're totally right.
36)  CARLEY
[warm] {happyA}Good. I think it's {fearA}for the best.
37)  CARLEY
[whispers, like in your boyfriend's ear] {happyC}Don't call me small.
38)  CARLEY
[whisper in ear] {happyC}Try not to play stoic. It makes your forehead crinkle.
39)  CARLEY
[whispered in lee's ear] {happyC}You're gonna have to be more talkative if this is gonna work.
40)  CARLEY
[whispered in lee's ear] {happyC}You'll thank me later.
41)  LEE
{AngryA}No. I'm not doing that. {NormalD}People have enough to worry about.
42)  CARLEY
{fearA}What are you so afraid of? {ThinkingA}Three months ago I told you to tell no one and now I'm telling you to tell everyone. Do you think it's because they'll turn on you? {AngryC}We almost got eaten for fuck's sake.
43)  CARLEY
{normalA}Things are different now.
44)  CARLEY
{fearA}I hope you change your mind.
45)  CARLEY
{NormalA}Now. Um, {fearA}is there anything else you want to talk about?
46)  LEE
{thinkingA}No, actually, I'm going to go.
47)  CARLEY
{normalA}Okay.
161)  LEE
{normalA}Okay.
48)  CARLEY
{normalb}Good idea.
49)  LEE
{thinkingA}I'm going to look into this thing.
50)  LEE
{normalA}I'll talk to you later.
51)  CARLEY
{happyA}I'll talk to YOU later.
52)  
You know anything about missing meds?
53)  
Do you have any chalk I can borrow?
54)  
You have any thoughts about Lilly?
55)  LEE
{normalA}Hey Car.
56)  
You think people are ready to hear about me?
57)

62)

100)  LEE

{thinkingA}And?
111)  CARLEY
{thinkingA}And?
72)  CARLEY
{happyA}That wasn't so hard, was it tough guy?
112)  CARLEY
{happyA}That wasn't so hard, was it tough guy?
73)  LEE
{happyA}He was cool. He just worries about his family.
113)  LEE
{happyA}He was cool. He just worries about his family.
74)  LEE
{sadA}I don't know. Feels like I just gave him ammo if we ever have to make any tough decisions when it comes to a head count.
114)  LEE
{sadA}I don't know. Feels like I just gave him ammo if we ever have to make any tough decisions when it comes to a head count.
75)  CARLEY

81)  CARLEY
{happyA}Thanks for doing that.
82)  CARLEY
{thinkingA}Really?
83)  LEE
{normalA}Yeah. {sadA}She thinks supplies have been walking away.
84)  LEE
{thinkingA}There's some broken equipment too. {normalA}I'll look into it.
85)  LEE
{normalb}No, not yet. {normalA} I will.
86)  LEE
{sadA}She was fine, I guess. I think she's more upset about Kenny.
121)  LEE
{sadA}She was fine, I guess. I think she's more upset about Kenny.
87)  CARLEY
{sadA}Because of the St. Johns? What exactly did he do back there?
119)  CARLEY
{sadA}Because of the St. Johns? What exactly did he do back there?
88)  LEE
{normalC}Don't you start, now.
120)  LEE
{normalC}Don't you start, now.
89)  CARLEY
{normalA}She adores you. {happyA}Don't worry.
122)  CARLEY
{normalA}She adores you. {happyA}Don't worry.
90)  LEE
{sadA}I don't know. {thinkingA}She's tough to read.
123)  LEE
{sadA}I don't know. {thinkingA}She's tough to read.

{thinkingA}You really think people are ready to hear about me?
140)  CARLEY
{thinkingA}It's not a matter of ready or not. {normalB}There's never going to be a good time {sadA}but there are going to be a lot of bad ones. {normalC}Right now doesn't seem like one of them.
141)  CARLEY
{thinkingA}I don't know, this place is fine but we all know that that could change any second.
142)  LEE
{thinkingA}Do you feel safe here?
143)  CARLEY
{normalB}Show me a bath with a heated floor in a highrise apartment and hand me a full-bodied Malbec, and then I'll feel safe.
144)  LEE
{thinkingA}You have any thoughts about Lilly?
145)  CARLEY
{sadA}I worry about her. That's about it. {normalb}She keeps trying to run things but it's just not working.
146)  LEE
{normalC}So you don't have any?
147)  LEE
{thinkingA}Do you have any chalk I can borrow?

Do you know anything about this flashlight?
156)  LEE
{normalD}Do you know anything about this flashlight?

{angrya}I know it's broken.
163)  CARLEY
{normalA}And the batteries might be in backwards.
164)  CARLEY
{normalA}It's broken.
165)  CARLEY
[pickup2] But everyone's different. Who knows how each person would take it, you know? Maybe it's worth thinking about who you want to tell.
166)  CARLEY
[pickup2] You don't have to tell everyone, but think about who you trust and take the opportunity while you have it.
