103)  KATJAA
{fearB}My goodness, for what? {fearB}How much trouble can a teacher get into?
104)  LEE
{NormalD}It was for murder.
105)  KATJAA
[sigh, unhappy] {fearB}Why?
106)  KATJAA
{NormalB}Tell me what happened when you were locked in the fridge. {AngryA}At the dairy.
107)  LEE
{SadA}He and my wife {SadB}were...
108)  LEE
{AngryA}Well, plenty, {AngryA}but it had nothing to do with that.
109)  KATJAA

You need to try harder with Lilly.
119)  
You guys trust everyone here?
120)  LEE
{fearA}You need to try harder with Lilly. {angrya}You guys gotta straighten this out.
121)  KENNY
{normalb}Don't know how straight we can get it given all that's happened.
122)  LEE
{thinkingA}So what then?
123)  KENNY
{angrya}Time'll come we'll have to do what's best for our families, and that's what we'll do.
124)  KENNY
{ThinkingA}More or less. {NormalA}I obviously have my problems with Lilly but I don't distrust her.
125)  KATJAA
{NormalA}Yeah, we can't turn on each other any more than we have.

131)  KATJAA
[reminded] {NormalA}I saw some broken glass over by the ice machine. {ThinkingA}I meant to clean it up before the kids hurt themselves on it; {NormalA}I forgot though.
132)  KATJAA

133)  LEE
{normalA}Hey you two, how are you doing?
134)  KATJAA

135)  KENNY
{normalC}Just having a little spat.
136)  KATJAA
{angryA}We all carry guns now and, well, I don't like it.
137)  KENNY
{angryA}It's the way it's gotta be.
138)  KATJAA
{angryA}I know, but I'm not getting used to it.
139)  LEE

140)  
Have you seen any chalk around?
141)  LEE

145)  KENNY
{normalA}Well I don't know anything about that.
146)  LEE
{normalA}Yeah, of course. I'll talk to her.
147)  LEE

148)  LEE
{NormalB}I'll talk to you later.
149)  
Do you guys know anything about missing meds?
155)  LEE
Do you guys know anything about missing meds?
150)  KATJAA

152)  KENNY
So what's the problem?
153)  KENNY
Shit, things are missing?
154)  LEE

156)  
About the guns...
162)  LEE
About the guns...
