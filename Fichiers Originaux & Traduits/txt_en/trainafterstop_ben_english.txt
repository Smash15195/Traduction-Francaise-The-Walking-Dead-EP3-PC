2)  
Carley didn't have to die.
3)  
Doug saved your life.
4)  
Anything ELSE you need to say?
5)  
Aren't many of us left.
6)  LEE
{thinkingA}What are you doing out here?
7)  LEE
{thinkingB}Anything else?
8)  BEN
{fearA}I guess not.
9)  BEN
{fearA}I, uh, couldn't be back there anymore. {sadB}I needed some air.
10)  BEN
{sadC}I was thinking about talking to Kenny...
11)  BEN
{sadA}Yeah... {thinkingA}you, me and Kenny. Clementine. {fearB}The homeless dude, if he sticks around.
12)  LEE
{sadA}Aren't many of us left.
13)  
We're all homeless.
14)  
I don't know if we can count on Kenny.
15)  
You going to be able to step up?
16)  BEN
{sadA}Yeah... I guess not.
17)  LEE
{sadB}There's not much use in describing people by who they were.
18)  LEE
{sadA}We're all homeless.
19)  BEN
{disgustA}You know what I mean.
20)  LEE
{sadC}We just don't know.
21)  LEE
{thinkingA}Why didn't you try to find them?
22)  BEN
{thinkingA}I guess.
23)  LEE
{angryA}Well, what happened to Kenny is different.
24)  BEN
[pickup 2] [new read:Emphasis is off. Should be 'nobody would GO with me' not 'nobody would go WITH 
me.']{fearA}I...{fearB}nobody would go with me. {sadB}It was a while ago.
25)  BEN
{thinkingA}He's driving the train okay.
26)  LEE
{sadB}I don't know if we can count on Kenny.
27)  BEN
{sadA}I lost everybody I've known 'cause of this. {sadB}I didn't even get back to my house. {sadC}Who knows what's up with my parents.
28)  LEE
{thinkingB}Are you going to be able to step up?
29)  LEE
[a little firm] {angryA}Good. I hope that's true.
30)  BEN
{thinkingA}I can do just as much as anyone else.
31)  BEN
{sadA}...I wish it was more than that. {fearA}Just us guys and Clementine. {sadB}It's not great.
32)  BEN
{sadA}Yeah.

38)  LEE
{angryB}Good. You can never tell Kenny, you understand?
39)  BEN
{fearB}But--
40)  LEE
{angryC}Do NOT. You don't sell us out to the bandits, they never attack, Duck never gets bitten. He'll kill you.
41)  BEN
{sadC}I just... I want him to know --
42)  LEE
{angryB}Bullshit. You want to feel better.

49)  LEE
[pickup2] [heavy] {sadB}Yeah, maybe.
50)  BEN
[pickup2]{fearA} ...You still want to talk to me?
51)  
Not really.
52)  
Not much choice.
53)  
Yeah.
54)  LEE
[pickup2] [cold and dissmissive, do you still want to talk to me after i got everyone killed?] {angryA}Not really.
55)  BEN
[pickup2][sad] {sadC}I didn't think so.
56)  LEE
[pickup2]{angryA}I don't have a lot of choice, unless you're going somewhere.
57)  BEN
[pickup2]{fearA}I...I guess I'm not. [are you going anywhere? like, are you leaving the group since you fucked up so bad?]
58)  LEE
