1)  LEE
{angryA}Where'd he go?
2)  CLEMENTINE
[pickup 2] [new read: Good read, but the emphasis is off. Their emphasizing more 'don't be mad' rather than just making it one statement of 'I said don't be mad.'] {sadA}I said "don't be mad."
3)  LEE
[to clem] {angryA}I heard you.
4)  LEE
{angryA}I'll be right back.
5)  LEE
{sadB}It's not safe.
6)  CLEMENTINE
{fearA}Just a trim, right?
7)  CLEMENTINE
[sad] {sadB}Oh no, what happened?
8)  LEE
{sadA}So, you're probably not going to like this.
9)  CLEMENTINE
[remembering a shitty thing]  {sadB}Yeah...
10)  LEE
{surpriseA}Nothing. {sadA}We have to talk about your hair.
11)  CLEMENTINE
{angryA}That's not nice.
12)  CLEMENTINE
{sadA}Are you saying it smells?
13)  LEE
[puzzled] {thinkingA}What?
14)  LEE
{happyA}No. [half laugh sigh]
15)  LEE
{thinkingA}I need to cut it short enough so that it can't get grabbed.
16)  CLEMENTINE
[disappointed sigh] {sadA}Okay.
17)  LEE
{sadA}Well that could happen again. And if it's a walker, well.... We need to trim it.
18)  CLEMENTINE
{sadB}Because it does, kinda.
19)  LEE
{thinkingB}Do you remember when Andy St. John grabbed it? And I got mad?
20)  
So... here's the thing about your hair.
21)  
Chuck had a point.
22)  
I'm going to look around for a few things.
23)  
I want to talk about Savannah.
24)  
You need to learn to protect yourself.
25)  
Be careful around Ben.
26)  LEE
{thinkingA}Try to get some rest.
27)  LEE
{thinkingA}I'll be right back.
28)  CLEMENTINE
Okay.
29)  
What do you think about Chuck?
30)  
What a crappy day.
31)  CLEMENTINE
[relaxes] Okay. What should we do?
32)  LEE
{thinkingA}Well, we're going to figure out a plan for when we get to Savannah, {happyA}teach you how to protect yourself and, uh, tidy you up a little {FearA}so you can't get grabbed so easily.
33)  CLEMENTINE
I'd like that.
34)  LEE
{happyA}Good.
35)  LEE
{sadB}Chuck had a point, you know.
36)  LEE
{thinkingA}Look, we're not going to let anything bad happen to you. {sadA}But there are some precautions we have to take.
37)  CLEMENTINE
Okay, yeah, that makes sense.
38)  LEE
{happyA}Don't worry, sweet heart.
39)  LEE
{happyA}Hey, Clem.
49)  LEE
{happyA}Hey, Clem.
279)  LEE
{happyA}Hey, Clem.
40)  CLEMENTINE
Did you talk to him?
41)  LEE
{thinkingA}I did, he had some, {sadB}uh... he explained himself and made some good points.
42)  LEE
{thinkingA}How are you doing?
46)  LEE
{thinkingA}How are you doing?
43)  CLEMENTINE
My hands hurt and my ears have a noise in them.
44)  CLEMENTINE
[makes a ringing noise to illustrate what she's talking about]
45)  LEE
{sadA}You'll get used to it.
47)  CLEMENTINE
Good. I'm glad we have a plan.
48)  LEE
{happyA}Me, too.
139)  CLEMENTINE
{happyA}Me, too.
50)  CLEMENTINE
Hi.
51)  
Cut hair
52)  
Wait
53)  LEE
{thinkingA}Mind if we do this now?
54)  CLEMENTINE
{sadB}I guess not.
55)  LEE
{normalD}Don't mope. {happyA}It's a good thing.
56)  LEE
{thinkingA}You know, we don't have to to do this right away.
57)  CLEMENTINE
{happyA}Okay, good.
58)  CLEMENTINE
That would be good. I hope it's safe there.
59)  LEE
{sadB}God, me too.
60)  LEE
{thinkingB}I need to look around for a few things that'll make sure we're prepared when we get to Savannah.
61)  CLEMENTINE
{fearB}Do you know how to do this?
62)  
Nope. No idea.
63)  
How hard can it be?
64)  
Yeah, of course.
65)  CLEMENTINE
{sadC}I'd rather be dead.
66)  LEE
{angryA}Shush now.
72)  LEE
{angryA}Shush now.
67)  LEE
{sadA}Nope. No idea. {thinkingA}I'm not much of a stylist, you know.
68)  CLEMENTINE
[flat] {sadB}I'm going to look like a boy.
70)  CLEMENTINE
[flat] {sadB}I'm going to look like a boy.
78)  CLEMENTINE
[flat] {sadB}I'm going to look like a boy.
69)  LEE
{happyA}But think of how much safer you'll be.
71)  LEE
{happyA}How hard can it be?
73)  LEE
{thinkingA}It means you know when someone is lying to you, {happyA}which is another valuable survival skill.
74)  LEE
{happyA}Yeah, of course.
75)  CLEMENTINE
{sadA}I don't believe you.
76)  LEE
{thinkingA}Well...good.
77)  CLEMENTINE
{thinkingA}Good?
79)  LEE
[with regret] {sadA}Yep.
80)  CLEMENTINE
{sadA}So you did kill someone, before.
81)  CLEMENTINE
{sadA}I'm glad you finally told me.
82)  LEE
{sadB}Me too.
83)  CLEMENTINE
{thinkingA}You've killed lots of things now; {sadA}it doesn't even matter.
86)  CLEMENTINE
{thinkingA}You've killed lots of things now; {sadA}it doesn't even matter.
84)  LEE
{sadC}I'm sorry.
85)  CLEMENTINE
{thinkingA}You could've just told me. {sadA}I wouldn't have been afraid of you or anything.
87)  
No. It's different.
88)  
Killing is bad, no matter what.
89)  
You're right.
90)  CLEMENTINE
{thinkingA}Did people ever go to jail when they shouldn't?
101)  CLEMENTINE
{thinkingA}Did people ever go to jail when they shouldn't?
91)  LEE
{thinkingA}All the time.
102)  LEE
{thinkingA}All the time.
92)  LEE
{sadB}I was sent to jail.
93)  CLEMENTINE
{thinkingA}But you do it now to protect yourself -- and to protect me.
97)  CLEMENTINE
{thinkingA}But you do it now to protect yourself -- and to protect me.
94)  LEE
{sadA}No, it's different.
95)  LEE
{thinkingB}Killing is bad, no matter what.
96)  CLEMENTINE
{thinkingA}But you have to.
98)  LEE
{sadA}It doesn't make it good.
99)  LEE
{angryA}I do it because it's necessary. And walkers aren't people.
100)  LEE
{thinkingA}You're right.
103)  LEE
{thinkingB}Before all of this, I was sent to jail, you know.
104)  LEE
{happyB}There, all set.
105)  CLEMENTINE
{happyA}Here, I have some hair thingies.
106)  CLEMENTINE
{thinkingA}Uh, yeah. {happyA}Lilly gave them to me for sleeping.
107)  LEE
{happyA}Okay, I think I'm about done. {thinkingA}I can probably tie these pieces back with something.
108)  LEE
{thinkingA}You do?
109)  LEE
{happyA}Ha, no. You look cute -- {thinkingA}and a lot harder to grab.
110)  CLEMENTINE
{fearA}Does it look dumb?
111)  LEE
{thinkingB}Be careful around Ben.
112)  CLEMENTINE
I like Ben.
113)  LEE
{sadA}I know. He's just...young. And doesn't make the best choices.
114)  CLEMENTINE
I'm young.
115)  LEE
{happyA}You're smart. {thinkingA}Just, listen to me, okay? And be careful.
116)  LEE
{sadB}What a crappy day.
117)  CLEMENTINE
The crappiest.
118)  LEE
{sadA}If three months ago I'd have known what you'd be seein', I don't know if I would've taken you with me.
119)  CLEMENTINE
I probably would've run out of food.
120)  LEE
{angryA}You damn near starved with me.
121)  CLEMENTINE
I'm glad I came with you.
122)  LEE
{fearC}What the?! Do what he said! I'll be right back!
123)  KENNY
OH, SHIT! HOLD ON EVERYBODY!
124)  LEE
{thinkingA}All right. How do you feel?
125)  CLEMENTINE
{thinkingA}Good. {happyA}Better. {happyB}I'm glad we have a plan.
126)  LEE
{happyB}And you're a good little shot.
127)  CLEMENTINE
{happyA}Thanks.
128)  LEE
{thinkingA}I guess we should see how far--
129)  CLEMENTINE
I don't know.
130)  LEE
{normalD}We'll keep an open mind about him. {sadA}He's probably had it pretty rough.
131)  CLEMENTINE
You think?
132)  LEE
{thinkingB}Me, neither. {thinkingA}He might be an okay guy, though.
133)  LEE
{thinkingA}What do you think about Chuck?
134)  CLEMENTINE
[nervous] {fearA}Okay. Okay.
135)  LEE
{thinkingA}First, don't be afraid of it. It's just a thing. Take it.
136)  LEE
{thinkingA}But know where your finger is all the time. {angryA}And don't put it on the trigger unless you want to hurt somebody.
137)  LEE
{angryA}You need to know how to protect yourself.
138)  LEE
{thinkingA}I mean with one of these.
140)  LEE
{thinkingB}And what we're going to do when we get there. We don't know what to expect -- {sadA}the city could be bad or {happyA}totally under control.
141)  LEE
{normalD}I want to talk about Savannah.
142)  
We should look for your parents.
143)  
We need to help find a boat.
144)  
We should go our own way.
145)  CLEMENTINE
{fearB}Well, uhh... I want to find my parents. {fearA}We've come all this way. We have to.
146)  LEE
[small] {sadA}Okay.
147)  LEE
{happyB}The thing is, you and I, we're a team, you know? And a team needs plan.
148)  LEE
{happyB}Ha, good.
149)  CLEMENTINE
A plan. I like it.
150)  LEE
{thinkingA}Yeah. {sadA}You need to know if they're okay. And, {sadB}well, if they're not, what happened to them.
151)  CLEMENTINE
{happyA}I'm sure they're okay.
152)  LEE
{sadA}I think we should look for your parents.
153)  CLEMENTINE
Really?
154)  
Don't get your hopes up.
155)  
I think I heard them die.
156)  
Yeah, stay positive.
157)  CLEMENTINE
{FearA}No. I don't care about safety. {sadA}I care about finding them.
158)  CLEMENTINE
{thinkingB}Okay, but, {fearB}we'll be IN Savannah and my parents were in Savannah.
159)  LEE
{sadA}I know, look--
160)  LEE
{thinkingB}We need to help find a boat. It's our best bet at safety.
161)  
They're dead. We have to move on.
168)  
They're dead. We have to move on.
162)  
Okay. We'll look for them but THEN a boat.
163)  
Where would we even look?
164)  LEE
{thinkingA}We should go our own way when we get there. {sadB}Our crew is falling apart. You and I are stronger alone.
165)  LEE
{sadA}He'll be fine.
166)  CLEMENTINE
{fearB}Can we at least LOOK for my parents when we get there, before we go?
167)  CLEMENTINE
{thinkingA}What about the boat... what about Ben?
169)  
Okay. We'll look for them but then we move on.
170)  
Where would we look?
171)  LEE
{happyA}Aside from everyone else, when this train stops you and I should know exactly what we're doing.
172)  CLEMENTINE
{thinkingA}Okay.
173)  LEE
{sadA}Don't get your hopes up.
174)  LEE
{thinkingB}Let's look at the map. If we can figure out where they were we can start there.
180)  LEE
{thinkingB}Let's look at the map. If we can figure out where they were we can start there.
184)  LEE
{thinkingB}Let's look at the map. If we can figure out where they were we can start there.
186)  LEE
{thinkingB}Let's look at the map. If we can figure out where they were we can start there.
199)  LEE
{thinkingB}Let's look at the map. If we can figure out where they were we can start there.
228)  LEE
{thinkingB}Let's look at the map. If we can figure out where they were we can start there.
175)  CLEMENTINE
{happyB}Okay, let's.
181)  CLEMENTINE
{happyB}Okay, let's.
200)  CLEMENTINE
{happyB}Okay, let's.
226)  CLEMENTINE
{happyB}Okay, let's.
176)  CLEMENTINE
[firm but ont he verge of tears] {sadC}They're not dead.
194)  CLEMENTINE
[firm but ont he verge of tears] {sadC}They're not dead.
218)  CLEMENTINE
[firm but ont he verge of tears] {sadC}They're not dead.
177)  LEE
{sadC}I think I heard them die.
178)  CLEMENTINE
[small] {cryingA}Do you want them to be?
195)  CLEMENTINE
[small] {cryingA}Do you want them to be?
217)  CLEMENTINE
[small] {cryingA}Do you want them to be?
179)  LEE
{sadB}Don't be ridiculous. [revealing] {fearA}I don't want you to get hurt any more than you have.
182)  CLEMENTINE
{happyA}That's what dad always says.
183)  LEE
{fearA}Yeah, it's best to stay positive.
185)  CLEMENTINE
[firm] {thinkingB}I know they're okay.
187)  LEE
{sadC}They're dead. We have to move on.
216)  LEE
{sadC}They're dead. We have to move on.
188)  LEE
{happyA}Okay. That's the plan.
214)  LEE
{happyA}Okay. That's the plan.
222)  LEE
{happyA}Okay. That's the plan.
238)  LEE
{happyA}Okay. That's the plan.
189)  LEE
{sadC}I'm sorry. Don't cry.
211)  LEE
{sadC}I'm sorry. Don't cry.
219)  LEE
{sadC}I'm sorry. Don't cry.
240)  LEE
{sadC}I'm sorry. Don't cry.
190)  CLEMENTINE
[getting over crying] {cryingA}If...we don't find them, then lets get on the boat. {happyA}If we do they can come with us.
213)  CLEMENTINE
[getting over crying] {cryingA}If...we don't find them, then lets get on the boat. {happyA}If we do they can come with us.
191)  LEE
[sigh] {sadC}We're following through with the boat, but we'll look for your parents first.
210)  LEE
[sigh] {sadC}We're following through with the boat, but we'll look for your parents first.

193)  LEE
{sadB}Come here, hon.
212)  LEE
{sadB}Come here, hon.
221)  LEE
{sadB}Come here, hon.
239)  LEE
{sadB}Come here, hon.
196)  LEE
{thinkingB}Okay. We'll look for them.
229)  LEE
{thinkingB}Okay. We'll look for them.
197)  LEE
{sadA}Yes, of course. I'm sorry.
225)  LEE
{sadA}Yes, of course. I'm sorry.
198)  CLEMENTINE
{happyA}Really?
227)  CLEMENTINE
{happyA}Really?
201)  LEE
{sadA}Clementine...
236)  LEE
{sadA}Clementine...
202)  CLEMENTINE
{fearA}I can remember where they were staying. Maybe they didn't go far.
232)  CLEMENTINE
{fearA}I can remember where they were staying. Maybe they didn't go far.
203)  CLEMENTINE
{fearB}Please, Lee.
235)  CLEMENTINE
{fearB}Please, Lee.
204)  LEE
{thinkingB}Where would we even look?
233)  LEE
{thinkingB}Where would we even look?
205)  LEE
[relents] {sadB}All right. Let's figure that out on the map, but a boat is the ultimate plan.
206)  CLEMENTINE
{sadA}Yes. {fearA}They can come with us, right?
231)  CLEMENTINE
{sadA}Yes. {fearA}They can come with us, right?
207)  LEE
{sadA}Yes.
234)  LEE
{sadA}Yes.
209)  CLEMENTINE
[quietly sobs, sniffles]
243)  CLEMENTINE
[quietly sobs, sniffles]
215)  LEE
[aww...] {sadC}Look...
241)  LEE
[aww...] {sadC}Look...
223)  CLEMENTINE
{sadB}If we don't find them we can go. {happyB}But if we do they can come with us.
224)  LEE
{sadB}We need to separate from the group but we'll look for your parents first.
230)  LEE
But then we're moving on.
237)  LEE
{sadB}All right. Let's figure that out on the map, {sadC}but then we're getting out of town. We have to stay moving.
244)  LEE
{thinkingB}I really think we have to keep moving. But we can look for your parents first.
245)  CLEMENTINE
[getting over sobbing] {sadC}If we don't find them it's okay... we can leave Savannah like you said.
246)  LEE
{thinkingA}And from there, we've got all of Savannah to the southwest of us.
247)  LEE
{thinkingA}It looks like we'll come right through town if there's nothing on the tracks to hold us up.
256)  LEE
{thinkingA}It looks like we'll come right through town if there's nothing on the tracks to hold us up.
259)  LEE
{thinkingA}It looks like we'll come right through town if there's nothing on the tracks to hold us up.
248)  LEE
{thinkingB}We're gonna want to look for a boat here [points], I imagine.
249)  CLEMENTINE
{fearB}I don't like the woods.
250)  LEE
{angryA}And, unless Savannah is somehow walker-free we know we want to stay out of town.
251)  CLEMENTINE
{happyA}So we can't get surprised by walkers.
252)  CLEMENTINE
{happyB}I like the beach.
253)  CLEMENTINE
{fearB}Are we going to have to live in the woods?
254)  LEE
{happyB}Good.
255)  LEE
{thinkingB}Well, what I think we should do -- after we look for your mom and dad -- is head north, keeping water -- the ocean -- on our right side.
257)  LEE
{sadA}You don't like the woods?
258)  LEE
{happyA}Exactly.
260)  LEE
{thinkingB}Now, we've got a good chunk of Savannah here. What do you think?
261)  CLEMENTINE
{thinkingA}They always stay in the same place when they go there. {sadA}It's uh...hmm.
262)  LEE
{happyA}Right. [new thought]
263)  LEE
{thinkingB}The M-- ... M something. Muh...Muh...
264)  CLEMENTINE
{thinkingA}It's like a house or something.
265)  LEE
{thinkingB}Wait, did they leave your babysitter a note?
266)  CLEMENTINE
{happyA}Yeah! {thinkingA}It would be sort of irresponsible not to.
267)  LEE
{happyA}All right, so that's where we'll head.
268)  LEE
{happyA}The Marsh House? Is that what it said? {thinkingA}Does that ring any --
269)  CLEMENTINE
{happyB}Yes! That's it! We stayed there once and the restaraunt has chocolate mousse!
270)  LEE
{happyA}You think we have a good plan?
287)  LEE
{happyA}You think we have a good plan?
271)  CLEMENTINE
{happyA}I think it's very good.
286)  CLEMENTINE
{happyA}I think it's very good.
272)  CLEMENTINE
{happyB}Me, too.
273)  LEE
{happyA}That wasn't so hard. {thinkingA}Glad I snooped around your kitchen.
274)  CLEMENTINE
{thinkingA}Once.
275)  LEE
{happyA}Have you ever been there?
276)  LEE
{thinkingA}Well, think about it --  there are a lot of hotels on here, but read this map and maybe it will jog your memory.
277)  LEE
{thinkingA}Hey. Don't worry, we'll figure it out.
278)  CLEMENTINE
{happyA}Like hiding or running away, got it.
280)  LEE
{thinkingA}I'm sorry about your hair. {happyB}I think it looks cute, though.
281)  CLEMENTINE
[grumpy]My mom isn't going to like it.
282)  CLEMENTINE
{thinkingA}They've got really tasty desserts. It's called the M..M something...Mar...
283)  LEE
{thinkingA}Is this it? The Marsh House?
284)  LEE
{happyA}So we'll head there.
285)  CLEMENTINE
{happyB}Yes, that's it.
288)  CLEMENTINE
{happyA}Yes!
289)  LEE
{happyA}You'll get stronger.
290)  LEE
{thinkingA}See, it's not scary.
291)  CLEMENTINE
{sadA}It's heavy.
292)  LEE
{thinkingB}To aim, you look right down the top, through that notch.
293)  LEE
Line up the site at the end with your target.
294)  LEE
Good. Don't lock your elbows.
295)  LEE
{thinkingA}Okay, aim a little a bit more left.
296)  LEE
{thinkingA}A little bit more to the left.
297)  LEE
{thinkingA}Aim lower.
298)  LEE
{thinkingA}A little bit lower.
299)  LEE
{thinkingA}Okay, a little higher.
300)  LEE
{thinkingA}Aim a little higher.
301)  LEE
{thinkingA}A bit to right.
302)  LEE
{thinkingA}Aim more to the right.
303)  LEE
{happyA}Excellent, good shot.
304)  LEE
{happyA}There you go, nice.
305)  LEE
{angryA}Yeah, you do.
306)  CLEMENTINE
{sadB}Do I have to?
307)  LEE
{thinkingA}Let's stick with it, okay?
308)  CLEMENTINE
[scream/squeel] {fearC}EEP!
309)  LEE
{fearA}You okay?
310)  CLEMENTINE
[pickup 2] [new read: Should be My hands hurt.] {sadA}My hands hurt. I don't like this.
311)  LEE
{thinkingA}Okay, let's take your first shot. Squeeze the trigger smoothly and I'll cover your ears. Nice and easy.
312)  CLEMENTINE
{thinkingA}Nice and easy.
313)  CLEMENTINE
[pickup 2] [newread: should be nah uh - read indicates yes.] Nuh-uh. [no]
314)  LEE
{happyA}Yeah, you did. Good job.
315)  CLEMENTINE
{happyB}I did it!
316)  CLEMENTINE
Okay. I feel good.
317)  LEE
No, far from it. But you know how these things work now. We'll graduate you to walkers one day.
318)  LEE
Not so scary, eh?
319)  CLEMENTINE
They're not walkers, though.
320)  CLEMENTINE
[pickup2] [nervous] Is there anything else I should know?
321)  
Squeeze the trigger, steadily.
322)  
Take a breath, hold it and fire.
323)  
Aim for the head.
324)  LEE
[pickup2]Squeeze the trigger, steadily, okay? Don't give it a quick yank or pull.
325)  CLEMENTINE
[pickup2] Steady. I can do that.
326)  LEE
[pickup2] Everytime. It'll be tough, but just remember to do that and you'll hit what you're aiming at.
327)  CLEMENTINE
[pickup2] Okay. I'm ready.
328)  LEE
[pickup2] When you're ready to shoot, make sure you're not breathing too hard and then hold your breath right when you pull the trigger.
329)  CLEMENTINE
[pickup2] Like when I'm swimming?
330)  LEE
[pickup2] No -- just for a quick second. I found that if I did that I was a lot more accurate. It's tough, but it'll help.
331)  CLEMENTINE
[pickup2] I can do that. Okay.
332)  LEE
[pickup2] Head or body. Anywhere.
333)  CLEMENTINE
[pickup2] I don't want to think about that.
334)  LEE
[pickup2] You're right. It might be a lot for your first day. You ready?
335)  CLEMENTINE
[pickup2] Yeah, I'm ready.
336)  LEE
[pickup2] Unless it's not a walker and it's someone trying to hurt you.
337)  CLEMENTINE
[pickup2] [after a beat] ...and then?
338)  LEE
[pickup2] I know these are just bottles, but you have to aim for the head.
339)  CLEMENTINE
[pickup2] I know. Only the head.
340)  CLEMENTINE
[pickup2]  I guess I probably know everything then. [grumbles] Being a little girl, and all.
341)  CLEMENTINE
I squeezed the trigger, just like you said.
342)  LEE
I know; you did good.
343)  LEE
See? You did good.
344)  CLEMENTINE
I was holding my breath and the gun didnt shake so much.
345)  CLEMENTINE
I just pretended they were walker heads.
346)  LEE
Good, just like you should.
347)  CLEMENTINE
I didn't even need more advice!
348)  CLEMENTINE
{happyB}I got it!
349)  LEE
{happyB}[pickup2]On your first shot; good job.
350)  
Aim left.
351)  
Aim right.
352)  
Aim lower.
353)  
Aim higher.
354)  CLEMENTINE
[pickup2]Can I... tell my parents? You know. [the "you know," is a small, ambiguous nod to the fact that she's been talking into this "broken" walkie-talkie thinking she can communiate with her parents]
355)  LEE
[pickup2] Sure, go ahead. [warm, but humoring clementine out of compassion]
356)  CLEMENTINE
[pickup2][so small. tiny. wind out of your sails.] You can't tell me what to do.
357)  LEE
[pickup2] CLEMENTINE. [intimate convo distance, she's said something that upset you and you're saying "don't be like that"]
358)  CLEMENTINE
[pickup2]I don't want to talk about it anymore.
359)  LEE
[pickup2] Clem... come on. That's not a good idea.
360)  LEE
[pickup2] Close; now keep it steady.
361)  LEE
[pickup2] Steady, now. Almost got it.
362)  CLEMENTINE
[pickup2] [smallish] They'll like it. Promise.
363)  
Keep it steady.
364)  
Keep it steady.
